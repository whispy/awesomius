00:19:08 <TheWhisper> ?edsgd
00:19:10 <TheWhisper> lol
00:21:17 <R0tt3n> dat arrowbot
00:22:29 <TheWhisper> Medos, just read the Make It Pretty article
00:22:46 <TheWhisper> I guess it's true that being pretty is in someways part of the function
00:22:48 <TheWhisper> of a thing
00:22:54 <TheWhisper> and not just a result of the function
00:23:15 <TheWhisper> Maybe instead of 'form follows function'
00:23:49 <TheWhisper> It should read: Form is function, and function is partially form 
00:23:51 <TheWhisper> ;)
00:23:54 <TheWhisper> :P
00:25:47 <R0tt3n> le
00:27:11 <R0tt3n> anyone know how EDSGD did that WWF ad in his portfolio?
00:27:20 <TheWhisper> Does anyone besides me mistrust overly designed things?
00:27:26 <TheWhisper> Like
00:27:31 <TheWhisper> I trust http://www.weather.gov/ over weather.com
00:27:36 <TheWhisper> *www.weather.com
00:27:39 <R0tt3n> what do you mean by overly designed?
00:27:45 <TheWhisper> well
00:27:49 <TheWhisper> look at those two links
00:27:58 <TheWhisper> and tell me which one has a better design
00:28:10 <R0tt3n> weather.com
00:28:12 <TheWhisper> I guess for me I judge them not just by the design
00:28:19 <TheWhisper> but also by what I know of the thing itself
00:28:24 <TheWhisper> i dunno
00:28:32 <TheWhisper> r0tt3n, which site would you think is more accurate?
00:29:23 <R0tt3n> more accurate? hmmm, i dunno Weather.com has some unrelated articles on their fontpage and weather.gov is more straight to the point
00:29:43 <TheWhisper> Say I wanted to find the 7 day forecast for my location
00:29:46 <R0tt3n> id say weather.gov is more accurate
00:29:49 <TheWhisper> why?
00:30:00 <TheWhisper> I don't mean in terms of having more narrow content
00:30:02 <TheWhisper> i mean
00:30:08 <TheWhisper> If i go to both for the 7 day forecast
00:30:11 <TheWhisper> which  do I think will be right
00:30:17 <TheWhisper> *more right
00:31:30 <R0tt3n> I dont know aha, weather.com is definitely easier to navigate through thats for sure
00:32:07 <TheWhisper> lol
00:33:15 <TheWhisper> I think maybe some of it is the belief 
00:33:21 <TheWhisper> that if someone spent so much time worrying about the design
00:33:31 <TheWhisper> then maybe their product didn't get enough attention
00:33:59 <TheWhisper> I mean, I usually find that I am more likely to trust undesigned computer programs over ones that have nice design
00:34:05 <TheWhisper> I dunno
00:34:38 <TheWhisper> brb ff update
00:34:41 <R0tt3n> I can see the logic behind that
00:35:08 <TheWhisper> though maybe it's also because undesigned software is usually smaller than overly designed software that serves the same function

00:40:44 <TheWhisper> change what around?
00:41:07 <medos> you can .forget COMMAND
00:41:28 <medos> then you can do a new .rem COMMAND what the command says
00:41:28 <TheWhisper> ah
00:41:53 <TheWhisper> how is that different than just overwriting with a second .rem?
00:42:18 <medos> .rem medos
00:42:26 <medos> .rem medos overwrite
00:42:30 <medos> oh

00:46:53 <TheWhisper> oh lol
00:47:00 <TheWhisper> The users can add amounts to the reward
00:47:02 <TheWhisper> welcome trolls
00:47:28 <TheWhisper> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2147483647
00:47:42 <TheWhisper> It's a Mersenne Prime
00:47:56 <TheWhisper> The number 2,147,483,647 is also the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer in computing.
00:47:58 <TheWhisper> I see
00:47:59 <TheWhisper> lol
00:48:15 <TheWhisper> It is therefore the maximum value for variables declared as int in many programming languages running on popular computers, and the maximum possible score, money etc for many video games. The appearance of the number often reflects an error, overflow condition, or missing value
00:48:17 <TheWhisper> hahaa

05:19:20 <medos> autoruns
05:19:26 <medos> hostsfile customized
05:19:33 <medos> boottime defrag
05:24:27 <EDSGD> so much to learn
05:24:33 <EDSGD> I'm falling behind
05:25:58 <medos> not sure if it's worth to learn
05:26:30 <EDSGD> Hmmm I think its coming along Great!!! :D http://i.imgur.com/WjCH5.png
05:30:18 <medos> looks a little forced
05:31:44 <EDSGD> Now  that you said
05:31:58 <EDSGD> shitty dripped could be better executed
05:32:26 <EDSGD> badly set type on the left side could've been done a bit better
05:32:47 <EDSGD> and the images feel as if I sjust placed it there with no thought whatsoever
05:32:52 <EDSGD> difficult this is
05:35:57 <EDSGD> medos
05:36:03 <medos> yeah
05:36:05 <EDSGD> remember the nasa thing I brought up
05:36:17 <EDSGD> well asked fellow redditors and stuff
05:36:29 <EDSGD> and they gave me a great idea I think
05:36:31 <EDSGD> :D
05:36:44 <EDSGD> I'm doing some redesign for class
05:36:53 <EDSGD> since nasa is hella cuttered
05:37:01 <EDSGD> with information
05:37:16 <EDSGD> well they suggested
05:37:20 <EDSGD> *said
05:37:29 <EDSGD> why not seperate the content
05:37:55 <EDSGD> One for regular people and another area for children
05:38:04 <EDSGD> seems like a good idea
05:38:18 <medos> hard to evaluate
05:38:26 <EDSGD> without seeing
05:38:28 <EDSGD> ??
05:38:30 <medos> if there's a special kids section that looks too kiddy
05:38:40 <EDSGD> its a turn off
05:38:41 <EDSGD> ?
05:38:46 <medos> grown ups might be shied away from clicking the funnnnnn stuff
05:39:00 <medos> and end up with analytical space dirt data graph comparisons in the grown up area
05:39:31 <medos> what i can tell you: most grown up nasa nerds loooove 'dem space pix
05:39:39 <medos> that's all i really have
05:39:43 <EDSGD> hahah yeah
05:39:44 <EDSGD> hmmm
05:39:58 <EDSGD> I'll see what I come up with throughout the week
05:40:03 <EDSGD> and toss em on here

15:01:24 <medos> see you next year
15:01:27 <TheWhisper> that I would defrenzy or whatever
15:01:31 <TheWhisper> to my system fonts
15:01:34 <EDSGD> I didnt say this
15:01:36 <TheWhisper> and only have the default system ones installed
15:01:39 <EDSGD> and yes The Whisper
15:01:47 <TheWhisper> and then all the other ones would be stored uninstalled
15:01:53 <TheWhisper> and I could activate/deactivate those with nexus
15:01:57 <TheWhisper> Is that a good strategy?

15:05:52 <EDSGD> It would be great if you don't do stuff similar to this : "w8" and "atm"
15:06:07 <EDSGD> I would greatly appreciate it. 
15:06:32 <TheWhisper> lol
15:06:39 <TheWhisper> w8 = win 8

15:16:46 <TheWhisper> Why?
15:16:47 <medos> http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101220055517AAMBNq3
15:16:48 <TheWhisper> What about that?
15:16:56 <medos> you can throw files in that folder
15:17:04 <medos> and those will only be available in adobe software
15:17:08 <TheWhisper> hm
15:17:28 <TheWhisper> Why do that over the method I listed above?
15:17:41 <TheWhisper> Besides ease of use I guess
15:17:49 -!- cyoz [~cyoz@88.130.186.0] has joined ##reddit-gd
15:17:55 <medos> both
15:17:58 <medos> hey cyoz :)
15:18:01 <cyoz> hey there
15:18:11 <TheWhisper> Hi
15:18:13 <TheWhisper> Do both?
15:18:29 <medos> TheWhisper both because the "Common Files\Adobe\Fonts" folder will not require you to run Nexusfont constantly
15:18:40 <medos> so you throw the most important non-windows fonts in there
15:18:47 <TheWhisper> ah
15:18:49 <TheWhisper> okay
15:18:51 <TheWhisper> http://virtualshacklesimagestest.appspot.com/serve/qolRogues.jpg lol
15:18:53 <TheWhisper> I see
15:19:05 <TheWhisper> So if I add that, my initial method sounded okay too?
15:19:10 <medos> yeah :)
15:19:42 <TheWhisper> And, as far as you know, Defrenzy works well and won't kill me?
15:20:06 <medos> unless you're running windows 8 where it would kill the font that has most system glyphs in it
15:20:13 <medos> it shouldn't hurt
15:20:18 <TheWhisper> lol
15:20:19 <TheWhisper> okay
15:20:23 <TheWhisper> well I'll do a snap beforehand anyway
15:20:34 <medos> how many do you have?
15:20:45 <TheWhisper> uh
15:20:52 <TheWhisper> 3128 currently
15:20:54 <TheWhisper> lol
15:21:03 <medos> in your fucking Windows\Fonts folder?!
15:21:04 <TheWhisper> because I installed the adobe folio
15:21:07 <TheWhisper> before thinking about it
15:21:08 <TheWhisper> yes
15:21:10 <TheWhisper> ;(
15:21:21 <medos> Oh deeeeear.
15:21:29 <TheWhisper> I'm hoping I'll notice an exponential speed inrease
15:21:32 <TheWhisper> *increase
15:21:38 <TheWhisper> but tbh things don't seem that slow 
15:21:40 <TheWhisper> but who knows
15:21:42 <TheWhisper> we'll see
15:21:47 <TheWhisper> Is there like a windows font process?
15:21:59 <medos> there's a font cache file
15:22:14 <medos> the thing that vlc doesn't like too much and rebuilds sometimes
15:22:45 <medos> http://techdows.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/Building-font-cache-dialog-box-of-VLC-Media-Player.png
15:22:53 <medos> Same thing goes for windows itself.
15:22:56 <TheWhisper> yeah
15:22:57 <TheWhisper> where is it
15:23:06 <medos> just use ccleaner
15:23:35 <TheWhisper> Should I do that before defrenzy
15:23:36 <TheWhisper> or after
15:23:48 <TheWhisper> probs after
15:24:04 <medos> restore point
15:24:07 <medos> or system image
15:24:09 <medos> if you're in doubt
15:24:14 <TheWhisper> yeah
15:24:28 <medos> i tend to have all important system fonts organized though as i fucked this up plenty of times
15:25:22 <TheWhisper> .xkcd
15:25:26 <TheWhisper> ^ funny today
15:25:36 <medos> by the way i invited cyoz to stop by here, he's a cool fella who sadly doesn't design much lately ;)

17:34:56 <medos> how does it fare in comparison to nexusfont?
17:35:35 <EDSGD> i don't know I've never used nexus font
17:36:31 <TheWhisper> Medos, is there a way to tell nexusfont to only scan for new/changed files on start
17:36:33 <EDSGD> how's nexus font compared to mah suitcase fusion?
17:36:38 <TheWhisper> as opposed to every damn time I switch a folder
17:41:38 <medos> Awesome?
17:42:48 <TheWhisper> ?
17:46:50 <medos> Organize your fonts better if loading annoys you.

18:04:14 <EDSGD> its true

18:04:29 <TheWhisper> and not a designer
18:04:32 <EDSGD> And people still sit on his dick
18:04:33 <TheWhisper> and if you put him in that category

18:18:00 <EDSGD> medos how does nexus file fair?
18:18:12 <medos> best free thing if you get used to it
18:18:18 <medos> just need to organize your fonts well enough
18:18:21 <medos> drag and drop folders
18:18:28 <TheWhisper> *fare
18:18:30 <TheWhisper> not fair
18:18:30 <medos> make sets for certain clients/uses/pairings
18:18:42 <medos> fair enough
18:19:14 <EDSGD> LOL

18:21:38 <EDSGD> where's all the cripyness>
18:21:44 <EDSGD> *crispy
18:22:40 <TheWhisper> what the fuck
18:22:43 <TheWhisper> I'm confused
18:23:31 <EDSGD> I'm sold! NexusFont maintains the library and your sets on the same removable  device even if the drive letter for the device changes. 						Carry your fonts on a USB flash drive with NexusFont. Then you can  use the fonts on it by just launching NexusFont on any computer. 						NexusFont does not make any changes to the Registry. 
18:23:48 <TheWhisper>  uh
18:23:49 <TheWhisper> medos http://i.imgur.com/I9H4E.png
18:24:41 <TheWhisper> http://stevehinesley.com/tutorials/adobe-photoshop-cs55-text-tool-error-could-complete-request-prevented-text-engine-initialized/
18:25:43 <TheWhisper> yeah that fixed it
18:26:55 <EDSGD> woah TheWhisper what are you linking to? http://i.imgur.com/jYR8p.png
18:27:14 <TheWhisper> a website for people who don't use shit like that
18:27:17 <TheWhisper> also
18:27:27 <TheWhisper> Nexus font auto-activates fonts?
18:27:33 <TheWhisper> medos so if like
18:27:36 <TheWhisper> i open photoshop
18:27:41 <TheWhisper> it auto activates all my fonts?
18:27:42 <TheWhisper> or what?
18:27:51 <TheWhisper> because I look in the font list
18:27:57 <TheWhisper> and fonts are there that are not installed
18:27:59 <TheWhisper> and they work fine
18:28:02 <TheWhisper> i don't get it :(
18:28:40 <TheWhisper> Lemme try opening with nexus closed
18:28:53 <medos> ?:D
18:28:54 <TheWhisper> even with Nexus closed, the fonts still show up!
18:29:10 <medos> to be fair
18:29:12 <TheWhisper> ?
18:29:16 <EDSGD> Try turning your computer off then turn it back on
18:29:22 <medos> you might need to toy around with nexus font
18:29:26 <medos> a little tiny bit
18:29:28 <TheWhisper> ?
18:29:43 <EDSGD> [le]ttle bit
18:30:00 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/7jTSj.png
18:30:07 <TheWhisper> lol
18:30:13 <TheWhisper> Medos, please explain :)
18:30:16 <TheWhisper> And I'll leave you alone
18:30:46 <medos> Step 1
18:30:51 <medos> learn stuff
18:30:53 <medos> step 2
18:30:55 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/pdVTc.png
18:30:57 <medos> do stuff?
18:31:01 <medos> step 3
18:31:03 <TheWhisper> ...
18:31:25 <medos> try to at least figure out how and when and why activation of fonts with nexusfont works
18:31:33 <EDSGD> so much detail then that blue line
18:31:49 <medos> yup
18:31:52 <EDSGD> Just get Suitcase 
18:32:07 <TheWhisper> lemme read the faw
18:32:09 <TheWhisper> faw
18:32:10 <TheWhisper> faq
18:32:28 <medos> http://help.xiles.net/nexusfont/
18:32:37 <TheWhisper> * When you see fonts in NexusFont, even though fonts are not installed, those fonts are available in all other programs.
18:32:39 <TheWhisper> If you close NexusFont, all fonts not installed are not available anymore in all other programs. 
18:32:40 <TheWhisper> okay
18:32:42 <TheWhisper> that makes sense to me
18:32:51 <medos> no way
18:32:56 <TheWhisper> But how come if I close nexusfont and open photoshop
18:32:59 <TheWhisper> those fonts are still there?
18:33:03 <TheWhisper> and they still work?
18:35:01 <EDSGD> medos follow meh on dribbble
18:35:03 <EDSGD> :p
18:36:15 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/bqyu9.png 
18:36:27 <TheWhisper> Can you  please explain that, medos? I don't see anything about it in the faq
18:38:01 <EDSGD> Hmmmm TheWhipser is making nexus font not seem all that great
18:40:18 <TheWhisper> OHHHH
18:40:33 <TheWhisper> Medos, does nexus only load fonts from the currently selected set/group?
18:41:04 <TheWhisper> hm
18:41:10 <TheWhisper> Nevermind, it still isn't working right for me
18:44:46 <TheWhisper> Medos, can you please take a second to explain to me how to use Nexusfont when you're done working? I'm having a lot of trouble with it.
18:44:53 <TheWhisper> keyword: when you're done working
18:45:01 <TheWhisper> so don't rage out

18:58:55 <EDSGD> should have listened to me
18:58:57 <TheWhisper> as I cleared it with ccleaner
18:58:58 <TheWhisper> like 2 times
18:59:00 <EDSGD> :D
18:59:01 <TheWhisper> just in case that was it
18:59:06 <medos> (17:23:19) (medos): just use ccleaner
18:59:12 <TheWhisper> I did
18:59:15 <TheWhisper> I did that
18:59:19 <EDSGD> first
18:59:20 <TheWhisper> like 10 minutes ago
18:59:22 <TheWhisper> I did that
18:59:23 <medos> 4 hours later
18:59:25 <TheWhisper> and it didn't work
18:59:27 <TheWhisper> no
18:59:34 <TheWhisper> I did it twice ten minutes ago
18:59:37 <TheWhisper> and it didn't fix it

19:08:19 <TheWhisper> .rem WhyIAsk I don't ask for help because I want an answer right away. It's more to help me work the problems out myself by clearly stating what the problem is. And, yes, if someone does have a solution that they can offer instantly, then that is of course nicer than me spending 10 minutes trying to figure it out.
19:08:26 <TheWhisper> ?whyiask

23:15:12 <TheWhisper> yup
23:16:50 <TheWhisper> http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1690611/lupe-fiasco-fans-shed-tears.jhtml lupe is a good guy
23:16:56 <TheWhisper> I've talked to him before
23:17:01 <TheWhisper> I was at a festival
23:17:07 <TheWhisper> and me and some friends snuck backstage
23:17:10 <TheWhisper> and we saw him brushing his teeth
23:17:27 <TheWhisper> so we sat down and waited and he walked over when he was done and was chillin with us a for a little
23:17:29 <TheWhisper> and then he had to go
23:17:39 <TheWhisper> and then greg gillis (girl talk) came over
23:17:42 <TheWhisper> and gave us wristbands
23:17:47 <TheWhisper> to go on stage during his set
23:17:49 <TheWhisper> and dance
23:17:53 <medos> I have no idea who that is :x
23:17:54 <TheWhisper> love them both
23:17:57 <TheWhisper> who who is?
23:18:00 <TheWhisper> lupe or girl talk?
23:18:06 <medos> All of it.
23:18:48 <TheWhisper> this is my favorite lupe song
23:18:50 <TheWhisper>  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GQjYPWDcmg
23:19:19 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glwhxRFhulo second fave
23:19:32 <TheWhisper> He's gotten really political recently though
23:19:46 <TheWhisper> but still awesome
23:19:47 <TheWhisper> uh
23:19:49 <TheWhisper> and girl talk
23:19:52 <TheWhisper> damn
23:19:56 <TheWhisper> he's a really good mash-up artist
23:20:01 <TheWhisper> (yeah, i know, not saying much)
23:20:03 <TheWhisper> but he's good
23:20:13 <TheWhisper> can't really give you a good song by him
23:20:21 <TheWhisper> as I only listen to his stuff by the whole album
23:20:26 <TheWhisper> as that's the only real way to listen to it
23:20:32 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JBAxkZun3s is the first song off his best album thugh
23:20:37 <medos> I'm confident that those songs will all be blocked for me.
23:20:43 <TheWhisper> lol
23:20:49 <medos> without clicking
23:20:50 <TheWhisper> if they are
23:20:52 <TheWhisper> lemme know
23:20:54 <TheWhisper> the girl talk ones shouldn't be blocked
23:21:02 <TheWhisper> as he's not on a big label
23:21:08 <TheWhisper> and lupe ones may not be because he's a good dude
23:21:10 <TheWhisper> lol
23:21:12 <medos> true

23:25:32 <TheWhisper> I love this dude
23:25:37 <TheWhisper> he's legit crying over his dead friends
23:25:40 <TheWhisper> then he gets better
23:25:45 <TheWhisper> and then he starts breaking down again
23:25:52 <TheWhisper> talking about how the new young black kids in chicago
23:25:57 <TheWhisper> how some of them aren't gonna make it out
23:26:06 <TheWhisper> It's nice to see someone showing some real emotion
23:27:15 <medos> weird

23:44:19 <medos> Google Chrome = Intense Caching + AE = Intense Caching
23:44:26 <medos> okay
23:44:49 <medos> HDD Fragmentation after AE = 30-40%

23:50:04 <TheWhisper> what?
23:51:42 <TheWhisper> HOLY FUCK
23:51:46 <medos> hugo_moss
23:51:49 <TheWhisper> "AT THE MOST...6 MINUTES"
23:51:52 <TheWhisper> and I was like
23:51:54 <TheWhisper> :OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
23:51:58 <TheWhisper> and then he was like
23:52:03 <TheWhisper> "6 weeks, I'm sorry"
23:52:16 <TheWhisper> literally my mouth dropped
23:52:22 <TheWhisper> wow lol
23:55:23 <TheWhisper> also
23:55:25 <TheWhisper> wow
23:55:26 <TheWhisper> that was really moving
23:56:20 <medos> it was honest
23:56:34 <medos> i'm rather careful with clicking random mtv links
23:56:54 <medos> So I haven't really checked that out yet.
23:56:59 <TheWhisper> check what out?
23:57:03 <TheWhisper> *checked
23:57:12 <TheWhisper> oh the lupe thing
23:57:58 <medos> yup
23:58:10 <TheWhisper> just watch it
23:58:11 <TheWhisper> and start at
23:58:13 <TheWhisper> 3:50 in
23:58:36 <medos> I don't know him as well as you do, sure it's the same thing without prior context?
23:58:41 <TheWhisper> yeah
23:58:44 <TheWhisper> well
23:58:45 <TheWhisper> i mean
23:58:50 <TheWhisper>  you can watch the whole thing
23:58:56 <TheWhisper> but really all you need to know
23:59:01 <TheWhisper> is he grew up in the chicago ghetto
23:59:07 <TheWhisper> and managed to get out
23:59:14 <TheWhisper> and he hates the whole ghetto life
23:59:23 <TheWhisper> that type of stuff
23:59:41 <TheWhisper> i mean it's really nice contrast if you watch the whole thing to see how full of energy and stuff he was when he was younger
