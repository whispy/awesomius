09:02:33 <medos> Good morning. :)
09:02:40 <Sat> hi there
09:02:59 <medos> Heyhey, welcome, first time visitor right?
09:03:22 <Sat> basically ye 
09:03:34 <Sat> was here once before a long time ago!
09:04:09 <medos> Yeah, quite a few people who stop by, see no chatting and leave after 5 minutes.
09:04:36 <medos> Freelancer, hobbyist, professional, student?
09:04:55 <Sat> lol, nah i hung around a bit, it's just i'm not in the habbit of using irc
09:05:23 <Sat> freelancer, currently without a website though
09:05:50 <Sat> yourself?
09:05:50 <medos> Same here. ;)
09:05:54 <Sat> hah
09:06:16 <medos> Freelancer who never gets around to actually setting a website up.
09:06:48 <medos> I just end up digging through stuff I have that might fit the potential client and link directly.
09:07:00 <medos> How do you get by without fancy website?
09:07:02 <Sat> same, it't not that great though
09:07:09 <Sat> well i work in print
09:07:35 <Sat> packagining, booklets, broucheres etc
09:07:40 <Sat> posters
09:07:58 <medos> The only field without fancy tutorials on the web.
09:08:16 <Sat> i'm a novice when it comes to html,css,java,actionscript etc
09:08:48 <medos> Yeah, I'm not really good at frontend stuff either, then again I don't feel like i have to be good at everything.
09:09:06 <medos> Rather focus and specialize than jack-of-all-trading.
09:09:20 <medos> Mind showing some stuff you did?
09:09:32 <medos> I'd be interested to see. :)
09:09:43 <Sat> sure 
09:11:24 <medos> On a sidenote: We have one guy in here who regularly looks for printing advice and guidance so if you stay for a bit you might get to answer a few questions.
09:11:53 <medos> Not forcing you though haha
09:11:56 <Sat> cool, and sorry just checking where i put these images online
09:12:51 <Sat> heres a few random things http://imgur.com/a/gLZFF
09:13:32 <medos> That's beautiful.
09:14:31 <Sat> lol thanks
09:15:10 <medos> I usually say awesome but the uniqlo one really looks impressive.
09:15:26 <medos> So that one earns the most respect. ;)
09:15:53 <medos> I think I saw the papercraft one in r/idesignedthis , right?
09:15:56 <Sat> i made that for a friend as a going away present, we always joked that it looked like all his clothes were bought by his mum at uni qlo
09:16:14 <Sat> nope, not from me :P
09:16:42 <Sat> so are you a expert in web programming?
09:17:25 <medos> The only thing i really really really like is Adobe Illustrator. :)
09:17:39 <medos> http://champ-ooh.minus.com/muCmRzAcm
09:18:24 <medos> (i'm the guy started this channel different nick on reddit)
09:19:24 <medos> Is uniqlo that shunned ? I'm in the uk sometimes and i always look forward to cheap but kind of good looking clothes.
09:19:25 <medos> oh dear
09:19:43 <Sat> oh cool, illustrator is ftw
09:19:52 <Sat> checking link

09:24:16 <medos> I'll be right back, have to take a shower and grab some breakfast. Will be back asap so feel free to stay. :)
09:24:21 <Sat> wow, lots of images there, the one that impressed me most is the 1st one, i love good infographics
09:25:03 <medos> Thank you. :) I got obsessed with it a little after failing to choose a router
09:25:14 <Sat> haha
09:25:34 <medos> If you can recommend one feel free to, right now i'm still running an old 54g one.
09:25:38 <medos> brb!
09:25:40 <Sat> one personal project im working on now is a series of infographics
09:26:36 <Sat> me recommneding a router would be like a blind man recommending a designer
09:31:05 <Sat> where are you from btw?
09:37:10 <medos> Germany!
09:37:11 <medos> :)
09:37:22 <medos> You?

09:44:25 <medos> and the culprit of nowadays minimalistic-poster trend
09:44:34 <medos> cell shading in which way?

12:17:59 <medos> btw. Sat don't follow guys who have nudes/girl albums because those tend to clutter the top of the news feed constantly

12:38:04 <Azra-el> .u golf
12:38:09 <medos> .u photoshop
12:38:32 <medos> why is that so tame
12:38:37 <medos> .u illustrator
12:38:40 <Azra-el> why did arrowbot ask me how old am i
12:38:52 <medos> thearrowfails what does .u do?
12:38:55 <Azra-el> and why is arrowbot so stupid today?
12:39:26 <Azra-el> lol... illustrator.. NOT a pretentious prgram? lol
12:39:44 <medos> urbandictionary tends to be irony aplenty
12:39:51 <medos> probably an ironic example of usage
12:39:58 <medos> google urbandictionary illustrator
12:40:29 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/IuP9I.png
12:40:34 <medos> 150 downvotes
12:40:37 <medos> lol
12:40:37 <Azra-el> .u screwdriver
12:41:07 <medos> i'll probably spend my day today digging through supybot code to fix shit
12:41:50 <Azra-el> why not add shit to skybot instead
12:42:00 <medos> read the topic
12:42:05 <medos> complaints about two bots pm medos
12:42:30 <Azra-el> thats what i meant.. why not fix skybot and keep only it ?
12:42:52 <medos> because people get butthurt
12:42:55 <medos> pm me and complain
12:43:00 <medos> then i have 1 complaint
12:43:03 <medos> not enough to remove it
12:43:20 <Azra-el> i can take him out if you want to... 
12:43:30 <medos> no
12:43:39 <medos> i like skybot more
12:43:43 <medos> but that makes two complaints
12:43:53 <medos> vs population of 10-15 guys
12:44:05 <Azra-el> at least skybot doesnt answer anything when its a bad command
12:44:08 <Azra-el> right?
12:44:13 <Azra-el> .fga 
12:44:20 <Azra-el> right
12:44:26 <medos> .idontwanttospendfivehoursarguingoverabotagain
12:44:36 <medos> so i take this as a complaint
12:44:39 <medos> two complaints so far
12:47:13 <Azra-el> imho .... since skybot does most of the things already... just take skybot and add what you need... supybot needs a lot more modifying
12:47:58 <medos> 2
12:48:02 <medos> complaints
12:48:08 <medos> doesn't change what you say
12:48:28 <medos> wait
12:48:58 <medos> (20:42:57) (@TheWhisper): lol
12:48:58 <medos> (20:43:07) (@TheWhisper): Medos can we get the reddit feature in awesomius?
12:48:58 <medos> (20:43:09) (@TheWhisper): I like that
12:49:00 <medos> 3
12:49:10 <medos> still not enough
12:49:35 <medos> so i'll spend my off time digging through supybot code to fix the annoying error messages that get posted in here
12:49:47 <medos> and propose those changes to thearrowfails
12:50:07 <medos> because he's busy playing crysis ;\
12:50:43 <medos> not too bad though, learning a bit pf py helps
12:51:04 <medos> *of python
12:56:11 <Azra-el> what reddit feature?
12:57:35 <medos> (05:26:37) (EDSGD): lol saw this on the front page http://i.imgur.com/1nOVo.jpg

12:58:39 <medos> no idea
13:02:58 <medos> that feature
13:03:13 <medos> thearrowfails what exact build of supybot is arrowbot running?
13:03:18 <medos> you said it's pretty much default config
13:03:19 <Sat> btw i got these recently, http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bodum-Pavina-glass-double-walled/dp/B00076ZD36/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1347022948&sr=8-2 expensive but worth it. i love drinking hot drinks from glass and cause of the design their is no heat transfer to your hand 
13:03:47 <medos> look shutupandtakemymoney worthy Sat

13:27:17 <medos> by the way: Sat i tend to not use cups or glasses at all anymore after ruining quite a few keyboards and equipment by throwing stuff over
13:27:33 <medos> i just have bottles standing around, closed ones
13:32:52 <Sat> i have a shelf next to me so i dont tend to spill stuff, however! i did spill my drink for the 1st time in ageeeeees yesterday, got lucky nothing damaged
13:33:49 <medos> my netbook started pressing shift on his own randomly after getting hit with orange juice
13:34:05 <Sat> sucks, wait
13:34:09 <Sat> i know what you need
13:34:28 <R0tt3n> I hate it when keys do that, my windows key on an old keyboard used to do that
13:34:29 <medos> that was a long time ago
13:34:30 <medos> :P
13:34:43 <medos> i bought a new keyboard, luckily that was easy with an eee 901

13:44:55 <medos> not switching left/right mouse button function
13:45:07 <Sat> werido!
13:45:35 <medos> http://editorial.designtaxi.com/news-bmwmouse0409/1.jpg
13:45:50 <medos> :P
13:46:00 <medos> I had no guidance telling me that i should mirror mouse functions
13:46:11 <medos> i think windows 3.1 didn't even allow it
13:46:18 <R0tt3n> that bmw mouse looks crazy
13:46:26 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/8Yibp.png
13:46:42 <medos> sorry, not an apple fan
13:47:08 <Sat> that things gonna cost a bomb, whenever car companys make anything non car (bicycles for example) its always crazy expensive
13:47:35 <Sat> btw what do you think of this http://www.minimallyminimal.com/2012/7/13/lunatik-touch-pen-alloy-polymer-lynk-and-antik.html  
13:47:42 <Sat> the nano as a watch
13:48:16 <medos> Can't wear watches
13:48:18 <Sat> (scroll to bottom for many picture) the strap is pretty neat aswell
13:48:53 <medos> watches tend to annoy when using my mouse
13:49:13 <medos> because most of my arm is actually on that huge mousepad in that pic up thar ^
13:49:39 <medos> grinding said watch over my laptop isn't really neat either
13:50:01 <Sat> i dont wear a watch and wouldnt wear one whilst on the computer. but as a accessory when out i think its pretty cool
13:50:26 <Sat> + when not a watch its a nifty ipod
13:50:40 <medos> True, needs huge arms and hands though to not make the it look gigantic
13:50:54 <Sat> ye thats the major downside
13:51:40 <medos> i'll be back in a bit, need to shop
13:51:45 <medos> last watch i had was a fossil
13:51:59 <Sat> ciao
13:52:13 <medos> those tend to be a good middle ground between sleek looking and not being overdone / huuuuge
13:52:16 <medos> see you later
13:52:17 <medos> ;)

14:32:06 <R0tt3n> so anyways, what you guys working on
14:32:58 <medos> fridge paaaaal
14:33:01 <medos> almost done
14:33:19 <medos> .u banana
14:34:01 <R0tt3n> banana
14:34:03 <medos> R0tt3n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8VPc-kgV6o
14:34:11 <medos> that's what i'm working on ;)
14:35:08 <R0tt3n>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
14:35:09 <medos> other stuff isn't really in a presentable shape yet
14:35:09 <R0tt3n>  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
14:35:17 <medos> lol
14:35:39 <medos> you asked
14:35:53 <R0tt3n> god damn I wish i knew illustrator as much as you do
14:36:48 <medos> be glad you don't , it creates constant 'hey how to do X' questions
14:37:08 <medos> nah just kidding, i'm always happy when someone at least tries to learn all the finer details about it
14:38:03 <marshmallow> =p
14:38:08 <R0tt3n> lol, do most users have all their panels and tool bars all over the place like that?
14:38:27 <R0tt3n> cause i like mine stacked neatly in the side ahha
14:38:37 <marshmallow> mine looks like photoshop
14:38:40 <marshmallow> interface
14:39:02 <medos> nope
14:39:08 <medos> i feel like i'm the only one who does this
14:39:34 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/94Bel.png
14:39:39 <medos> depends on what i do
14:39:55 <medos> sometimes the gradient toolbox needs to be wiiiiiide sometimes not
14:40:04 <medos> sometimes i just need basic shape crafting stuff
14:40:50 <medos> panels on the side = move mouse forther to access them = more time fiddling around to do stuff = less fun to do stuff
14:40:59 <medos> *farther
14:41:25 <marshmallow> panels on the side = easier to find = efficient
14:41:27 <marshmallow> XD
14:41:34 <medos> i know where my stuff is
14:41:34 <R0tt3n> lol
14:41:35 <medos> :P
14:41:47 <R0tt3n> eh different strokes i geuss
14:42:07 <medos> yup, not forcing my system on anyone
14:42:12 <R0tt3n> like your mouse situation medos
14:42:35 <R0tt3n> who the hell uses a lefthanded mouse without the left and right clicks remapped
14:42:44 <medos> i do
14:43:02 <medos> i just want to piss people off by being confusing for the most part
14:43:07 <medos> it's fun and efficient
14:43:32 <R0tt3n> i feel ya
14:44:36 <medos> *not piss off but make it a little tricky
14:44:45 <medos> would be a better way to say it
14:48:52 <medos> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91N2LP4ZBdA
14:48:55 <medos> unrelated
14:49:02 <medos> but awesome
14:51:22 <marshmallow> you're a lefty?
14:51:44 <medos> Yeah. Sometimes Ron Paul tickles my fancy but usually I'm pretty leftie.
14:52:21 <medos> is it lefty or leftie?
14:52:45 <Azra-el> *rim  shot for medos's reply*
14:53:26 <medos> lol
14:54:01 <marshmallow> idk, lol
14:54:45 <marshmallow> sucks for youuuu
14:54:52 <marshmallow> being in a righty dominated world XD
14:56:00 <medos> nah, it's just easier to get around most subliminal advertising techniques
14:56:28 <medos> supermarket built in a way that the longest route is always the right way around not left
14:56:34 <R0tt3n> ^please elaborate
14:56:51 <R0tt3n> oh
14:57:07 <R0tt3n> you've already elaborated
14:57:13 <medos> a little
14:57:19 <medos> not sure if i can come up with examples
14:57:42 <medos> but lots of ads are placed on the right side of the screen as there's a constant right-side preference for people
14:57:51 <medos> website, magazines
14:58:50 <medos> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket#Typical_store_architecture
15:00:42 <medos> tl;dr: https://vimeo.com/17083789
15:00:58 <medos> tl;dw: righties have an urge to walk right
15:02:30 <Sat> if you are in the middle of the desert and you try to walk in a straight line without a reference point i think the fact is that you will end up going in a complete circle. right handers would go right. left, left i think
15:02:46 <medos> yup that's what i think too
15:03:00 <medos> don't want to walk through a desert to prove it though
15:03:10 <medos> can't because i'd expect to walk left and try to balance it
15:03:16 <medos> fucking the whole experiment up ;)
15:03:31 <R0tt3n> lol
15:03:34 <R0tt3n> same
15:06:25 <medos> so righthanded world + leftie urge to act left = perfect balance
15:06:37 * medos pats himself on the back with his left hand
15:10:10 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/iIKS9.png
15:12:25 <R0tt3n> medos what tutorial sites would you reccomend for intermediate to advanced illustrator users
15:15:00 <medos> http://illustrationclass.com/category/free-tutorials/
15:15:05 <medos> http://www.digitalartsonline.co.uk/tutorials/
15:15:10 <medos> http://www.computerarts.co.uk/tag/illustrator?ct=tutorial
15:15:16 <medos> http://methodandcraft.com/videos
15:15:32 <medos> define intermediate to advanced :P
15:16:50 <R0tt3n> well like, I can trace images and manipulate type/objects
15:17:23 <medos> appreance panel?
15:17:28 <medos> do you have cs6?
15:17:49 <R0tt3n> yea
15:21:39 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobefiles/checkdatapperancepanel.ai
15:22:35 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/UjQZ9.png
15:22:56 <medos> if you grasp the apperance panel your life will get quite a bit easier
15:23:11 <R0tt3n> i see
15:23:23 <medos> it's similar to layer styles
15:23:26 <medos> just without limit
15:23:34 <medos> so one shape could have 100000 strokes and effects
15:24:21 <medos> while still being a simple box
15:24:26 <Azra-el> appearence panel is the best thing since slice bread
15:24:34 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/a6Pjr.png
15:24:36 <medos> plus ^
15:24:49 <medos> many people complain about weird and pixely looking shadows and effects
15:25:04 <medos> may just as well up the raster effect ppi setting to make those shadows smoooth
15:25:34 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/0HIN1.png
15:25:36 <medos> vs
15:25:43 <Sat> yes drop shadows on illustrator suck for me!
15:26:02 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/95b0b.png
15:26:06 <medos> not anymore
15:26:42 <medos> raster effect ppi does not affect the document itself being 72ppi
15:27:01 <medos> it's just more rendering for output
15:27:58 <medos> hooray for more skilled competition
15:27:59 <Sat> cool
15:28:24 <Sat> it was already set to 300 :S hmm must have changed recently without notcing
15:28:47 <medos> i tend to like glow/feather and blur more than the drop shadow setting itself
15:29:13 <R0tt3n> brb gotta switch rooms
15:29:51 <medos> hmh
15:30:01 <medos> well if you set your document up to start at 300ppi
15:30:09 <medos> that setting will obviously be retained
15:30:17 <medos> but even then you could (!) up it to 1200
15:30:21 <medos> or 1600?
15:30:27 <medos> not usually helpful though
15:31:00 <medos> 2400 apparently
15:31:25 <Sat> lol
15:32:08 <medos> clogging appearance panel & upping ppi settings = illustrator crashes more
15:32:10 <medos> :(
15:36:30 <marshmallow> =(
15:37:00 <medos> how many bingiton rounds have you made yet? :P
15:40:51 <medos> holy shit

16:22:00 <Sat> kudos accepted gratefully
16:22:01 <EDSGD> ????
16:22:16 <EDSGD> Terrible experience yesterday :p
16:23:24 <R0tt3n> what happend?
16:24:18 <medos> yesterday he was proud that his student was able to work with css
16:24:33 <EDSGD> HAHAHA there was that
16:24:37 <medos> if someone who never made a website before has a hard time with css i don't see a reason to be upset :P
16:24:47 <EDSGD> but the one I worked with later during the day
16:24:54 <EDSGD> seriously wanted to slap her
16:25:05 <R0tt3n> where do you teach?
16:25:12 <EDSGD> I tutor
16:25:12 <medos> ;(
16:25:16 <R0tt3n> oh
16:25:20 <EDSGD> I'm not a teacher
16:25:24 <medos> still a rude remark
16:25:50 <medos> if someone doesn't grasp it, make smaller steps in teaching / tutoring :P
16:25:51 <EDSGD> about slapping her?
16:25:58 <medos> yeah
16:26:01 <EDSGD> No, I know.
16:26:11 <medos> you could shift
16:26:14 <medos> the insults
16:26:24 <medos> from slapping and hating your tutored person
16:26:28 <EDSGD> What made me mad is the fact that she's been going to school for about a year and knew nothing.
16:26:32 <medos> to saying you wanted to smash your head against the wall
16:26:34 <medos> :P
16:26:37 <EDSGD> LOL
16:26:56 <EDSGD> she told me this I was like wtf what are you doing here>
16:27:17 <EDSGD> she comes and tells me Hey I have this assignment that I need to monday 
16:27:25 <EDSGD> and I haven't done anything
16:27:43 <medos> calculate the timespan she could've spent learning
16:27:47 <medos> and the timespan that is left
16:27:54 <medos> to teach her as much as she COULD know
16:27:56 <EDSGD> nor do I have basic understanding of photoshop
16:27:59 <medos> in that time
16:28:00 <medos> haha
16:28:12 <EDSGD> they were two assignments man
16:28:25 <medos> mh
16:28:36 <EDSGD> She was like I have the idea I just don't have anything
16:28:46 <Sat> gg
16:29:02 <EDSGD> and she was assigned this two weeks ago
16:29:03 <EDSGD> :(
16:29:13 <R0tt3n> LOL TWO WEEKS AGO
16:29:13 <medos> could've offered to take a wig and replace her during assignment day
16:29:25 -!- temporalD [~a_temp_di@bzflag/serverop/TemporalDistraction] has joined ##reddit-gd
16:29:26 <medos> she would've said "that's just stupid"
16:29:44 <medos> go figure
16:30:15 <EDSGD> LOL
16:30:17 <medos> don't you have a way to tell a higher up that she's at fault for failing?
16:30:29 <EDSGD> I am
16:30:39 <EDSGD> I'm going to do that today
16:31:03 <EDSGD> and what made it worst is that she could barely speak in a loud clear voice
16:31:40 <medos> maybe you shouldn't do the higher up thing :p
16:32:03 <EDSGD> I was like I can't hear you. and she was sitting next to me
16:32:06 <EDSGD> lol why not?
16:32:42 <medos> who knows why she's hard to understand?
16:32:57 <medos> the not-learned-enough part is valid reason to tell someone
16:33:00 <Sat> what subject in (school i presume?) requires photoshop knowledge?
16:33:02 <medos> but keep the rest out :p
16:33:22 <EDSGD> for execution.
16:33:50 <EDSGD> I am medos don't worry
16:34:07 <medos> neat
16:34:26 <medos> her not wanting to learn is going to make her trouble enough no reason to want to slap her :P
16:35:50 <EDSGD> Hey I did a poor job with indesign crap right now lol
16:35:57 * medos slaps EDSGD around a bit with a large trout
16:35:58 <EDSGD> 1GB packaged 
16:36:20 <medos> should've learned indesign ttyl
16:36:25 <medos> haha
16:36:49 <EDSGD> :p I'll make it smaller during the weekend
16:36:53 <EDSGD> I'll show you
16:37:11 <EDSGD> just too many assets for me to go through right now
16:38:09 <medos> .xkcd 353

16:43:38 <medos> http://haziqmir.com/
16:43:51 <medos> Hey MrLime did you get my last.fm comment? :))
16:44:19 <EDSGD> R0tt3n he is I can tell 
16:44:20 <EDSGD> http://i.imgur.com/KKJXz.png
16:44:56 <MrLime> yeah. Got it. The track is awesome 
16:45:18 <medos> Neat, I knew you'd like it, just wasn't sure if you knew it already. ;)
16:45:23 <R0tt3n> yeah lol, once i saw that
16:45:25 <R0tt3n> i knew
16:46:40 <R0tt3n> but shit man, hes good
16:53:00 <medos> OHHHH
16:53:05 <medos> that's why so many people stop by today
16:53:11 <medos> a post that references the sidebar
16:53:12 <medos> haha
16:53:12 <marshmallow> mrlime!
16:53:27 <medos> "As you may have noticed in the sidebar, we have started a reddit Donates campaign in the name of r/graphic_design."
16:53:29 <marshmallow> do you have an extra dribbble invite by any chance? =D
16:53:55 <medos> lol
16:54:10 <R0tt3n> ILL FIGHT TO THE DEATH WITH MARSHMALLOW FOR IT
16:54:25 <medos> i said be nice to people you might get an invite
16:54:32 <medos> because i got one that way
16:54:33 <marshmallow> LET'S D-D-D-DUELLLLLLLLllll
16:54:39 <medos> wasn't saying you should bug people for it
16:54:41 <medos> lol
16:54:47 <medos> sorry MrLime :(
16:55:06 <medos> i'll have to say in his name that he had one
16:55:19 <medos> derp
16:55:48 <medos> do good work, help people out = maybe you'll get one randomly
16:55:57 <medos> asking upfront out of nowhere = alienating
16:56:01 <medos> unless someone runs a contest
16:56:02 <medos> :p
16:56:09 <R0tt3n> medos, why havnt you put up any shots?
16:56:58 <medos> because i need to finish fridge pal and find a sleek way where i both make some promo for myself, thank the guy who invited me and have some url on my profile that shows more work
16:57:18 <marshmallow> =(
16:57:53 <R0tt3n> oh i see
16:58:27 <medos> private youtube videos and a minus.com profile with lots of work in progress/old stuff is not really apropriate
16:58:41 <MrLime> When I have some more invites in the future Graphic_Design and the IRC will be the first places I'll go.
16:58:57 <medos> < Will do the same.
16:59:02 <medos> ;)
16:59:13 <R0tt3n> keep it in the family guise
16:59:30 <medos> I would not entirely blind invite though.
17:00:11 <MrLime> of course not. The last time I gave one away (that wasn't you) I made a post and the most deserving designer got the invite 
17:00:46 <medos> As far as I know you don't get any invites after someone you invited posts subpar work.
17:00:48 <medos> :-P
17:01:17 <MrLime> You should be fine. R0tt3n and Marshmallow... Do you have portfolio's?
17:01:39 <R0tt3n> yeah, let me know what you think cargocollective.com/alexfilipe
17:02:02 <R0tt3n> like on what i should add/remove or if you hate everything or like something
17:02:03 <marshmallow> ummm, letme pull some of my more recent stuff up
17:02:17 <medos> mturk'd
17:02:18 <marshmallow> my webbie portfolio hasn't been updated in a long while
17:02:24 <medos> :P
17:02:25 <R0tt3n> I need dat feedback
17:04:05 <MrLime> I like your style. 
17:04:14 <marshmallow> semi-recent logos I created for friends' weddings.  All logos include the couple's initials.  All logos were made for free when bored.  All logos were loved by the bride and have/are being used in the actual wedding/reception.  http://yummymarshmallow.minus.com/mRtd25UNT
17:04:58 <medos> EDSGD belongs on that list too http://edwardsgd.com/ but he's on my watchlist now :P if he doesn't grab an invite without my help
17:05:10 <marshmallow> this is my most current favorite thing I've made: http://yummymarshmallow.minus.com/lbqD1fKggTQPTj  
17:05:19 <MrLime> "All logos were loved by the bride" - Good sign 
17:05:21 <medos> Sooo many links.
17:05:35 <R0tt3n> oh man i love his site
17:05:55 <medos> yup, it's pretty awesome
17:07:21 <MrLime> Very nice. I'll keep these in mind next time the dribbble invites roll in 
17:07:45 <medos> I'll just make a cool debut maybe you'll get them faster then. ;)
17:08:12 <marshmallow> yay!
17:09:44 <TheWhisper> r0tt3n that kid's logos are not good
17:10:03 <R0tt3n> i like his design is poster
17:10:45 <R0tt3n> but yeah like this http://iljamiskov.com/works/identity/alecoq/alecoqlogo.png
17:10:47 <R0tt3n> isnt good
17:11:10 <TheWhisper> medos do people post non-skeuomorphic, faux realistic, ultra-detailed shit on Dribble?
17:11:15 <medos> Yeah
17:11:23 <TheWhisper> Edsgd I never saw your finished site.
17:11:25 <TheWhisper> I like it
17:12:10 <R0tt3n> what the hell does non-skeuomorphic, faux realistic, ultra-detailed mean?
17:12:29 <medos> TheWhisper http://dribbble.com/o_fishel
17:12:29 <marshmallow> not all of the pics seem to load for me on edsgd's site =(
17:12:50 <TheWhisper> that's pretty detailed
17:13:14 <medos> I use flipboard and have a dribbble popular feed, it's not as iOS Icon texture obsessed as i thought
17:15:25 <medos> right now the two dudes i'd invite would be EDSGD or Azra-el
17:15:30 <medos> wouuuuuuuld
17:15:36 <medos> if they keep at it
17:15:40 <medos> and if i had any
17:15:50 <TheWhisper> ;9
17:15:52 <TheWhisper> ;(
17:15:53 <MrLime> You'll probably get some pretty quickly 
17:16:54 <TheWhisper> Who?
17:16:56 <TheWhisper> Me?
17:17:00 <medos> ?whisper
17:17:13 <TheWhisper> I actually was brainstroming in the shower
17:17:24 <TheWhisper> and had a few really good ideas to add on to my site design
17:17:28 <TheWhisper> or rather
17:17:32 <TheWhisper> to make my site design
17:17:35 <TheWhisper> just sketched them out
17:17:56 <medos> haha
17:18:05 <TheWhisper> ?
17:18:32 <medos> no idea, just do stuff like you critique stuff and you'll have no problems
17:18:37 <TheWhisper> haha
17:18:42 <TheWhisper> I wish I could just critiquez
17:18:43 <TheWhisper> like
17:18:46 <TheWhisper> writers have editors
17:18:51 <TheWhisper> why can't designers ;(
17:18:56 <medos> creative directors?
17:19:00 <TheWhisper> yeah 
17:19:04 <medos> kinda say "do that this sucks this is horrible"
17:19:12 <TheWhisper> but you need to have experience to do that

17:22:07 <medos> show me a dev site where it says don't let creatives touch copy
17:22:25 <medos> you'd probably make one just to give proof
17:22:28 <R0tt3n> lol, did you make your own layout? or is that one a template? Either way its awesome
17:22:30 <nazbot2> would I?
17:22:36 <medos> not sure yet
17:22:37 <medos> lol
17:22:38 <medos> :P
17:23:31 <nazbot-pc> i feel the need to defend myself against these baseless attacks
17:23:46 <EDSGD> yeah adds to the no idea what I was doing when I did this  :p took me about 6 weeks 
17:23:48 <medos> baseless
17:24:38 <R0tt3n> haha nice, anyways g2g see ya d00dz

17:26:05 <nazbot-pc> what type of website?
17:26:26 <medos> http://pea.rs/ ?
17:26:42 <MrLime> One client in the middle east. The other isn't responding to emails and the last one is still making his mind up. CLIENTS EVERYBODY!
17:27:04 <medos> lol MrLime
17:27:10 <medos> i thought middle east designers
17:27:23 <medos> are the ones that grab westen clients
17:28:10 <MrLime> This client came out of nowhere and still hasn't paid for the work so he won't be getting any :P
17:28:22 <EDSGD> racist medos
17:28:40 <medos> www.freelancer.com
17:29:37 <nazbot-pc> edsgd i couldn't tell if it was racist or not
17:29:43 <medos> design, media & architecture

17:32:58 <nazbot-pc> indonesia has some great design talent from what I've heard
17:33:03 <nazbot-pc> and those areas
17:33:13 <EDSGD> SOUTH KOREA DESIGN <3
17:33:17 <nazbot-pc> hehe yeah
17:33:22 <nazbot-pc> i love the simpsons jokes about that too
17:33:31 <nazbot-pc> where they show the places the simpsons are animated
17:34:12 <nazbot-pc> btw simpsons is 25 years old
17:34:14 <nazbot-pc> that's crazy
17:34:22 <EDSGD> Oh gawd I'm old
17:34:36 <nazbot-pc> yeah
17:34:40 <nazbot-pc> me too
17:34:42 <EDSGD> The simpson will never die
17:34:56 <EDSGD> since they mock current events
17:35:05 <nazbot-pc> well i was thinking about how there will eventually be a 'final' episode
17:35:13 <nazbot-pc> I don't watch tv anymore but that is going to be kind of nuts
17:35:25 <nazbot-pc> i have such an emotional attachment to that show
17:35:28 <EDSGD> hey I find it odd that the simpsons criticizes FOX even though it airs on FOX
17:35:30 <EDSGD> :p
17:35:42 <EDSGD> Same here 
17:36:04 <nazbot-pc> brb
17:36:22 <EDSGD> be back later

17:43:33 <medos> lol
17:43:36 <medos> marshmallow not really
17:44:01 <medos> I mainly participate in contests on www.99designs.com
17:44:05 <marshmallow> I was just curious how good that sight is
17:44:33 <marshmallow> is that crowdsourcing?
17:44:43 <medos> well
17:45:00 <medos> there are sites that do not focus on a guys ability
17:45:07 <medos> but rather rating and results
17:45:34 <medos> it's a very wobbly approach to a field where the result can be judged subjectively
17:46:44 <medos> same goes for www.odesk.com
17:47:24 <medos> i could earn money on freelancer
17:48:33 <nazbot-pc> whats your fav site meods?
17:48:42 <medos> http://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/w6bom/what_are_some_sites_where_i_can_find_freelance/c5an64o
17:48:44 <medos> for what
17:48:46 <medos> lol
17:49:05 <nazbot-pc> someone pls turn arrowbot off
17:49:11 <medos> 4 complaints
17:49:17 <medos> still not enough
17:49:29 <medos> ?dwi
17:49:29 <EDSGD> I love Arrowbot
17:49:48 <medos> 4:1 not enough
17:49:48 <nazbot-pc> arrowbot is fine
17:49:53 <nazbot-pc> but it shouldn't be automatic
17:49:54 <nazbot-pc> oy
17:49:56 <medos> lol
17:50:00 <nazbot-pc> arrowbot you suck
17:50:10 <medos> True.
17:50:15 <medos> that backfired
17:50:15 <nazbot-pc> arrowbot came from an abusive family
17:50:45 <marshmallow> oooh
17:50:53 <marshmallow> i'm le bored, better design
17:51:00 <medos> NO
17:51:02 <medos> WHYYYYY
17:51:05 <medos> do mturk
17:51:07 <medos> :D
17:51:16 <marshmallow> >:o
17:51:27 <medos> dontcha dare start drawing hands now
17:51:32 <marshmallow> i mturk enough
17:53:01 <EDSGD> damn I have a lot of crap in my bag
17:53:02 <medos> .commandnotfound
17:53:03 <EDSGD> :(
17:55:52 <marshmallow> how often do you win at 99design?
17:56:47 <medos> always
17:56:55 <medos> i always lose at sarcasm though
17:56:58 <medos> so it balances
17:56:59 <medos> :(
17:57:18 <medos> google no spec
17:58:20 <marshmallow> then why did you give me that link?
17:58:30 <marshmallow> (the 99design link)
17:59:18 <medos> i was making a joke :P
17:59:55 <medos> i can't compete with freelancer.com's designers who will likely just follow straight up tutorials most of the time
18:00:08 <medos> and i can't compete with even more people to make my living
18:00:21 <medos> as such the freelancer.com and 99designs.com links were jokes
18:00:32 <marshmallow> oh boo
18:00:34 <medos> sorry for not making that clear
18:00:42 <marshmallow> joke flew over my head
18:01:03 <medos> you're an employee though so i don't mind explaining
18:01:41 <marshmallow> yea, i know how everyone hates crowdsourcing
18:02:38 <medos> > 3. Half of the money upfront
18:02:38 <medos> Some sketches/ideas (low-res, watermarked, I don't care) first please.
18:02:41 <medos> email from yesterday
18:02:57 <medos> that's me doing some sketches for ---------- who knows
18:03:00 <medos> money maybe?
18:03:04 <medos> i don't do that
18:04:00 <marshmallow> gotchya
18:04:10 <marshmallow> i'm le bored though
18:04:20 <medos> feel free to participate on 99designs
18:04:27 <medos> i don't really mind it's a good first step
18:04:34 <marshmallow> looks really competitive
18:04:37 <medos> as it gives a fixed set of expectations
18:04:50 <marshmallow> and somewhat... err... generic
18:04:53 <medos> and you don't need to discuss/make any variations
18:06:54 <marshmallow> well, it seems like most people submit like 12 versions of their design in a contest
18:07:09 <marshmallow> like..  don't like it as a circle?  well how about as a square?
18:07:48 <medos> haha
18:07:59 <medos> could almost be seen as sarcasm
18:08:01 <medos> or irony
18:08:16 <medos> "eeeeya want 99 design suggestions? i'll give you twelve of those"
18:08:42 <marshmallow> that wasn't sarcastic..  that was straight up
18:08:46 <marshmallow> like, this contest: http://99designs.com/logo-design/contests/help-holidayguru-logo-162937/designers/857759
18:08:55 <medos> no
18:08:57 <medos> i meant
18:08:59 <medos> them
18:09:00 <marshmallow> person  submited the same thing except green..  then blue...
18:09:02 <medos> :P
18:09:04 <medos> lol
18:09:19 <medos> if someone who can't decide
18:09:25 <medos> posts a gig to get more options
18:09:35 <medos> the designers might likely be the same
18:09:43 <medos> can't decide on one style and offer several
18:10:02 <medos> also
18:10:07 <medos> color changes are easy
18:11:53 <marshmallow> yea
18:11:58 <nazbot-pc> 99 designs should use their own service to srpuce up their site
18:12:11 <marshmallow> or they change the font slightly...  or they change the gradient
18:12:18 <marshmallow> it's interesting to observe
18:13:47 <medos> depends on what you expect
18:13:55 <medos> http://graphicriver.net/forums/thread/envatos-most-wanted-2500-reward-for-the-first-25-retina-ready-user-interfaces/73191?page=1
18:14:41 <medos> oh no
18:14:43 <medos> they fixed it
18:14:45 <medos> lol
18:15:09 <medos> they wanted designers to submit files in 326ppi
18:15:12 <marshmallow> idk what a retina ready user interface is
18:15:27 <medos> well let's just say the guys who run a template and stock archive site
18:15:33 <medos> have no clue about what they actually sell
18:15:42 <medos> and made a derpy contest
18:16:00 <medos> because they thought no designer offered the right interface stuff yet
18:16:05 <medos> turns out designers did
18:16:08 <medos> lol
18:21:02 <marshmallow> lol
18:29:47 <marshmallow> woah!  I finally found a user who made decent money on that 99design site
18:30:08 <marshmallow> problem is, the dude entered 2,000+ contests.  has a 4% winning streak
18:30:29 <marshmallow> well, not 2,000+ contests.  more like 2,000+ submissions
