00:17:35 <TheWhisper> k
00:17:45 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/1XMyG.png
00:17:49 <TheWhisper> I also had
00:18:00 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/INlm1.png brush that i blurred
00:18:06 <TheWhisper> to get a little bit of darkness there
00:18:12 <TheWhisper> that i couldn't get on the gradient
00:18:28 <TheWhisper> hm let's judge whose was better
00:18:33 <TheWhisper> nazbot
00:18:35 <TheWhisper> you here?
00:18:50 <medos> no
00:18:52 <medos> show
00:18:52 <medos> me
00:18:53 <medos> your
00:18:55 <medos> gradient
00:18:56 <medos> slider
00:19:00 <TheWhisper> ?
00:19:03 <TheWhisper> Didn't I just do that?
00:19:08 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/INlm1.png
00:19:11 <TheWhisper> i mean
00:19:12 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/1XMyG.png
00:19:13 <TheWhisper> ?
00:19:14 <medos> oops
00:19:16 <medos> you did
00:19:16 <TheWhisper> That's the gradient slider?
00:19:18 <medos> didn't see
00:19:18 <TheWhisper> :P
00:19:21 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/czVGx.png
00:19:26 <medos> yours is pretty fucking horrible
00:19:46 <TheWhisper> Compared to yours?
00:19:47 <medos> because that's one color being reflected
00:19:49 <medos> yeah
00:19:53 <medos> you did a color gradient
00:20:04 <medos> a lens is not a fucking color gradient lol
00:20:16 <medos> technically it replicates well
00:20:20 <TheWhisper> Hm
00:20:25 <medos> in theory you fucked up
00:21:12 <TheWhisper> Yeah. Technically mine looks like super close
00:21:12 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/3Yw1X.png
00:21:23 <TheWhisper> But I see what you mean
00:21:25 <TheWhisper> Find the color of the lense
00:21:32 <TheWhisper> and then go darker/lighter from that
00:21:45 <TheWhisper> but you used greys
00:21:51 <medos> nope
00:21:58 <TheWhisper> ?
00:22:01 <medos> black at opacity
00:22:07 <medos> 20 or 60 or 40 or 69
00:22:09 <TheWhisper> yeah, same thing though
00:22:13 <TheWhisper> Aren't you not supposed to do that
00:22:29 <TheWhisper> Aren't you supposed to use different saturations/values of the base color?
00:22:29 <medos> no
00:22:32 <medos> not the same thing
00:22:38 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/EqUeC.png
00:22:56 <EDSGD> I went shopping :3
00:23:00 <EDSGD> ;3
00:23:00 <TheWhisper> yeah
00:23:01 <TheWhisper> but
00:23:05 <medos> but
00:23:07 <TheWhisper> How is that not the same thing?
00:23:20 <TheWhisper> You put low opacity blacks
00:23:25 <TheWhisper> over a pink or w.e
00:23:51 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/yQfDb.png
00:23:58 <medos> does this look like the same thing to you?
00:24:05 <medos> i switched 69 opacity black
00:24:14 <medos> with 69%black at 100% opacity
00:24:33 <TheWhisper> Ohhhh
00:25:12 <TheWhisper> I see
00:25:15 <TheWhisper> ish
00:25:44 <medos> if you have a green tshirt
00:25:48 <medos> and shade that green tshirt
00:25:51 <medos> and want it in blue
00:26:01 <medos> your approach fucks up
00:26:04 <medos> mine just changes color
00:26:07 <TheWhisper> Brb putting something in the oven

01:56:27 <TheWhisper> Grimm
01:56:31 <TheWhisper> .w grimm
01:56:41 <TheWhisper> .w list of grimm episodes
01:56:47 <TheWhisper> ^
01:56:51 <TheWhisper> First season was average
01:56:55 <TheWhisper> Second season is a lot better
01:57:13 <TheWhisper> Also, it's why i've been asking you about german words
01:57:17 <TheWhisper> because they speak german in it
01:59:27 <medos> subtitles?
01:59:35 <medos> even if they show german
01:59:43 <medos> that would be readable for me copy pasted
02:00:17 <TheWhisper> uh
02:00:37 <TheWhisper> I'm sure there are, but not in my downloaded versions lol
02:00:50 <TheWhisper> They don't usually do subs for the german speaking though either
02:01:07 <TheWhisper> You have to figure it out through context, though
02:01:19 <TheWhisper> I usually get it, but I never know what the exact translation is
02:01:31 <TheWhisper> like 'fleschen jachd' or w.e
02:01:36 <TheWhisper> was about some sort of hunt
02:01:41 <TheWhisper> but idk what it means exactly
02:07:52 <medos> something with bottles (flaschen) or meat (fleisch)
02:08:06 <TheWhisper> bottle hunt
02:08:06 <TheWhisper> lol
02:08:16 <TheWhisper> Fleish is more likely
02:08:29 <TheWhisper> *fleisch
02:08:30 <TheWhisper> as
02:08:31 <medos> flasche = colloquial for loser
02:08:31 <TheWhisper> flesh
02:08:32 <TheWhisper> yeah
02:08:38 <TheWhisper> flesh hunt sounds like it would fit
02:09:10 <TheWhisper> hm

16:04:40 <TheWhisper> "Heck, riding a bike in European cities varies wildly. Rome, you feel like the main character in a new way of mixing death sentence and reality show entertainment ("Will he survive this crossing? Oh, swift, he avoided the truck racing out of the one way in wrong direction!"). Netherlands, you feel like a first class citizen. "
16:04:41 <TheWhisper> lol
16:05:11 <TheWhisper> I guess I should probably wear a helmet when I start biking again

16:09:27 <TheWhisper> Why is Dropbox running for firefox...
16:10:23 <TheWhisper> Also, that's a nicely detailed orange clock hand

16:10:54 <TheWhisper> This guy must have been working at like 3x and then shrunk down
16:11:03 <internetpolice> http://dribbble.com/shots/759335-Needles-psd
16:11:54 <TheWhisper> His lighting is all weird
16:12:04 <internetpolice> yeah
16:12:08 <internetpolice> orange needle being the worst
16:12:50 <internetpolice> to be fair though those needles are going to be used separately
16:13:18 <internetpolice> so as long as each of them is properly lit by itself
16:14:13 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/DmyKW.png
16:14:30 <TheWhisper> yeah
16:15:03 <TheWhisper> I'm not too sure about how lighting on things like http://i.imgur.com/tYiFI.png are supposed to play out
16:15:25 <TheWhisper> whoa http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/13/3082329/ios-6-button-tilt-change-reflection
16:15:29 <internetpolice> varying lighting gives a surreal effect though
16:15:46 <TheWhisper> That's awesome
16:17:14 <TheWhisper> I feel like most people don't get the metal button reflections right anyway
16:17:23 <TheWhisper> But have no real life examples
16:17:24 <TheWhisper> so idk

16:19:08 <TheWhisper> okay sure

16:19:37 <internetpolice> lelele
16:19:47 <internetpolice> totally wrong
16:20:17 <TheWhisper> The perspectives on the icons look so radically off
16:20:34 <TheWhisper> also it looks like the bottom borders of them are pixel shifted 
16:20:35 <TheWhisper> lol
16:21:09 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/ToE7b.png I like that area though
16:22:00 <TheWhisper> also http://i.imgur.com/OEobM.png why doesn't the shelf just rotate and flip over
16:22:19 <TheWhisper> If it is loose enough that it stays flat when the main shaft tilts
16:22:24 <TheWhisper> what keeps it upright? :P
16:22:48 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/AiOsP.png
16:22:55 <internetpolice> such a fucking perfect balance
16:23:07 <internetpolice> that not only the wad of money and cubes are balanced
16:23:09 <TheWhisper> we should make a
16:23:16 <TheWhisper> stock repository of irl buttons
16:23:20 <internetpolice> but the wad of money and the cubes each balance the platform
16:24:00 <TheWhisper> hm
16:24:17 <TheWhisper> Pretty shitty scale if it requires the user to perfectly balance the items they place on it first :P
16:25:00 <TheWhisper> see if you can find a button repository on minus
16:25:09 <TheWhisper> I'm really surprised no one has made on before
16:25:44 <internetpolice> a wat
16:25:50 <internetpolice> repository wat
16:25:53 <internetpolice> button?
16:25:56 <internetpolice> you mean ui kit?
16:26:03 <TheWhisper> nah
16:26:03 <TheWhisper> Like
16:26:05 <TheWhisper> Real buttons
16:26:09 <TheWhisper> of all different kinds
16:26:18 <TheWhisper> so people can figure out how they actually work
16:26:29 <TheWhisper> instead of just doing shitty bad chrome brushed buttons
16:26:32 <internetpolice> http://dribbble.com/shots/329422-Clean-UI-Kit
16:26:34 <TheWhisper> that look shitty
16:26:37 <internetpolice> wat u tolkien aboot

16:31:23 <TheWhisper> lol
16:31:38 <TheWhisper> I'm just saying, a repository of these things would be nice
16:33:04 <internetpolice> a bit like
16:33:09 <internetpolice> .g chromeography
16:33:13 <internetpolice> ?
16:33:27 <internetpolice> just with brushed buttons?
16:33:30 <TheWhisper> Well

16:33:58 <TheWhisper> like just in front of me

16:49:56 <internetpolice> no u
16:50:00 <internetpolice> u install this
16:50:11 <EDSGD> He doesn't want to. I've told him in the past and afterwards he started sending me WWF/ WWE videos for a while.
16:51:03 <TheWhisper> Hm
16:51:21 <TheWhisper> I see. Is not installing that the external way you limit the time you spend watching random youtube videos? ;)
16:52:30 <TheWhisper> DAMMIT WHATISHANG if something hangs for <1 second, I still want to be able to see why!
16:52:53 <TheWhisper> They should at least have like a filter thing where you can say "if file = blank.exe, log all hangs"
16:52:54 <TheWhisper> or something
16:52:54 <EDSGD> Damn, Casshern Sins is getting interesting. <3 how old it feels watching it.

16:53:39 <TheWhisper> seriously
16:53:44 <internetpolice> yes
16:53:48 <TheWhisper> why
16:53:50 <internetpolice> because EDSGD liked it
16:53:55 <EDSGD> LOL
16:54:00 <TheWhisper> Still seems like a hassle
16:54:05 <internetpolice> if you post something it usually pisses him off
16:54:10 <internetpolice> if it doesn't
16:54:13 <internetpolice> it must be good

16:55:42 <medos> you know the story about

16:55:45 <medos> addons
16:55:46 <medos> tools
16:55:49 <medos> running?

16:56:59 <EDSGD> medos http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRebkWHsHC0
16:57:30 <TheWhisper> useless shit = a single script that only runs on youtube and doesn't even require an external extension to run it on chrome, because chrome can run greasemonkey scripts out of its own engine
16:58:09 <medos> says the guy with a context menu like a 2001 internet explorer toolbar
16:59:08 <TheWhisper> Hey, it looks a lot better http://i.imgur.com/rFuzk.png

17:00:05 <medos> nope
17:00:13 <TheWhisper> Maybe not for you
17:00:20 <TheWhisper> but it has the things I need to do on a regular basis
17:00:21 <TheWhisper> Well
17:00:36 <TheWhisper> I couldn't get rid of the scan with MSE
17:00:38 <TheWhisper> or the include in library
17:00:40 <TheWhisper> but otherwise
17:00:44 <TheWhisper> I use the other functions
17:00:56 <medos> mse is easy to kill off
17:01:01 <medos> .g mse context menu remove
17:02:42 <TheWhisper> yay
17:03:18 <medos> what kind of stuff are you running with sandboxie?
17:04:11 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/dv0K1.png thoughts?
17:05:06 <medos> yes
17:05:40 <TheWhisper> And I open things like keygens/sketchy files/etc
17:05:57 <medos> for what?
17:05:59 <medos> ?whisper
17:06:57 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/UwhoZ.png oh cool where did these randomly come from

17:07:25 <TheWhisper> no
17:07:28 <TheWhisper> keygens
17:07:32 <medos> do you
17:07:42 <TheWhisper> and that way I can turn off the music to them also
17:07:44 <medos> why not just
17:07:46 <TheWhisper> by just muting the sandbox
17:07:49 <medos> make
17:07:54 <TheWhisper> because the win7 volume controls don't wok
17:07:57 <TheWhisper> *work right
17:07:57 <medos> one virtual box
17:08:08 <medos> with winxp, no wlan, one read only folder
17:08:14 <TheWhisper> Seems like overkill
17:08:16 <medos> and alllllllllllll your bs can go in there?
17:08:30 <medos> seems like one solution that will work no matter what
17:08:37 <medos> even for safe tools that you want to try
17:08:50 <TheWhisper> Meh, everything works fine in sandboxie
17:09:53 <TheWhisper> dammit
17:09:58 <TheWhisper> I can't get include in library to go away

18:15:12 <TheWhisper> 5<Inexib5> I'm actually looking for a designer to develop a new brand for me. I own a clothing line.
18:15:53 <EDSGD> Facebook looks super generic now.
18:16:12 <TheWhisper> As opposed to when?
18:16:22 <EDSGD> Just sayin'
18:17:47 <TheWhisper> Edsgd, check http://branch.com/
18:18:13 <TheWhisper> <Inexib> Karma Apparel is the clothing line
18:18:13 <TheWhisper> <Inexib> And we make our own brands
18:18:13 <TheWhisper> <Inexib> So yeah, it would technically be a line of hsirts
18:18:14 <TheWhisper> wtf
18:18:21 <TheWhisper> This dude is saying that a line of t-shirts = a brand
18:18:21 <TheWhisper> wat
18:18:43 <EDSGD> Video is awful.
18:18:58 <TheWhisper> oh wwow
18:19:03 <TheWhisper> Yeah, the quality is super low for me
18:19:03 <TheWhisper> wtf
18:19:35 <TheWhisper> https://vimeo.com/47334795 if you view it on vimeo it's a lot better
18:19:57 <EDSGD> They can't even use the align tool http://i.imgur.com/qeRb5.png

18:20:48 <EDSGD> and in person.

18:23:15 <TheWhisper> shit what's that site
18:23:23 <TheWhisper> where people aggregate pieces of stories from different places
18:23:25 <EDSGD> qoura?
18:23:26 <TheWhisper> onto one page
18:23:29 <EDSGD> Reddit.
18:23:36 <TheWhisper> Nah
18:23:39 <TheWhisper> It's like
18:23:48 <TheWhisper> Say there's a dude holding someone hostage
18:23:54 <TheWhisper> they would take like chunks of that story
18:23:57 <TheWhisper> from one news source
18:24:00 <TheWhisper> a photo from another
18:24:02 <TheWhisper> a chunk from another
18:24:06 <TheWhisper> some stuff from twitter
18:24:07 <TheWhisper> etc
18:24:11 <TheWhisper> and put it all on one page

18:58:21 <medos> yeah
18:58:23 <medos> do it
18:58:31 <medos> get it out of your system
18:59:03 <TheWhisper> Google's stabilization tech makes videos worse
18:59:08 <TheWhisper> *Youtube's
18:59:56 <medos> show me yours i show you mine

19:00:54 <EDSGD> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU7Ngr1P3Ic
19:01:17 <EDSGD> I smear cream cheese
19:01:29 <EDSGD> on my gold locket 
19:01:30 <EDSGD> :D
19:03:07 <EDSGD> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dzrWMIumZ1s&feature=endscreen&NR=1 I remember this 
19:05:47 <EDSGD> LOL I remember this. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f2O7aVG72M
19:06:32 <TheWhisper> Whoa
19:06:41 <TheWhisper> Yours stabilized looks really cool, medos
19:06:45 <TheWhisper> I think
19:06:49 <TheWhisper> What does it look like unstabilized?
19:07:41 <TheWhisper> It's interesting how much your camera moves do for the video
19:08:06 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/JedgT.png
19:08:47 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/EOK6c.png
19:09:25 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8VPc-kgV6o&feature=source_video
19:10:01 <TheWhisper> Wait
19:10:11 <TheWhisper> The stabilization added those camera moves?
19:10:19 <TheWhisper> whoa
19:10:32 <TheWhisper> It made it /so/ much better
19:10:41 <medos> lol
19:10:54 <TheWhisper> That's actually really cool
19:12:09 <TheWhisper> Also, I finally realize why you have multiple windows open like that
19:12:20 <TheWhisper> because moving when zoomed in moves it less than a pixel
19:16:02 <medos> whatcha sayin' ?
19:16:29 <TheWhisper> ?
19:16:35 <medos> ohhh
19:16:42 <medos> you mean my preference for floating toolbars
19:16:46 <TheWhisper> nah
19:17:26 <TheWhisper> "At 100%, nudging with the arrow keys will move your vector point exactly 1 pixel. At 200%, nudging moves the point by half a pixel. At 300%, it moves by a third of a pixel."
19:17:36 <TheWhisper> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/04/14/mastering-photoshop-pixel-perfection-when-rotating-pasting-and-nudging/ ctrl+f nudging
19:17:46 <medos> booyee
19:18:00 <TheWhisper> What?
19:18:03 <EDSGD> BOI
19:18:30 <medos> .u boyee
19:18:36 <medos> .u booyee
19:18:44 <EDSGD> .u boi
19:19:12 <EDSGD> HAHAHAHAHA
19:19:36 <EDSGD> I did not know that.
19:20:02 <TheWhisper> whoa
19:20:02 <TheWhisper> http://bjango.com/images/articles/photoshopcs6masking/pathoperations.png
19:20:05 <TheWhisper> that's in PS now
19:20:09 <TheWhisper> weird
19:21:30 <medos> photoshop vector editing is still miles away from illustrator
19:21:32 <medos> :[
19:21:54 <TheWhisper> Ah
19:22:03 <TheWhisper> If you have pixel snapping enabled in PS
19:22:10 <TheWhisper> then nudging always moves one pixe
19:22:11 <TheWhisper> pixel
19:22:13 <TheWhisper> no matter the zoom
19:22:30 <TheWhisper> one pixel relative to current position
19:24:36 <medos> there are about 6 settings in AI which influence pixel / vectorpoint nudging behaviour
19:24:47 <medos> i say that's awesome
19:24:56 <medos> people say that sucks because they know half of them at most
19:25:22 <TheWhisper> http://bjango.com/articles/everythingisagrid/
19:26:46 <medos> i mailed bjango
19:26:54 <medos> and asked him about my rounded corners stuff
19:27:46 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/OEo5f.png
19:28:17 <EDSGD> Cool.
19:28:17 <TheWhisper> lame
19:28:25 <medos> now the kicker
19:28:34 <medos> i had plenty of feathered masks in my dribbble post
19:28:38 <medos> which i linked him two
19:28:40 <medos> *too
19:29:08 <medos> what happens a day later? :P
19:29:09 <medos> http://dribbble.com/shots/758642-Bjango-Actions-1-6
19:29:22 <medos> woooo actions for scaling feathered masks
19:29:50 <TheWhisper> lol
19:30:02 <TheWhisper> um
19:30:09 <TheWhisper> why couldn't you just paste them as a shape instead of a smart object?
19:30:49 <medos> wat
19:31:25 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0F9ZN8oXFA&feature=player_detailpage#t=224s
19:31:38 <TheWhisper> http://dribbble.com/shots/759119-PolyScript?list=popular&offset=1 oh cool low poly 3d
19:31:48 <TheWhisper> (sarcasm)
19:32:14 <TheWhisper> Can you not edit shapes that you paste in?
19:32:20 <TheWhisper> I've never tried
19:32:21 <TheWhisper> or anything
19:32:23 <TheWhisper> Probably not
19:32:37 <medos> you could manually adjust vector points
19:32:50 <medos> or you could use a smartobject which is a photoshop shape that you manually adjust
19:33:05 <medos> but the actual usage of this is that one edit influences a whole range of buttons
19:33:11 <TheWhisper> Yeah
19:33:33 <TheWhisper> okay work out time
19:34:53 <TheWhisper> ow
19:34:59 <TheWhisper> i think i pulled a muscle

19:55:30 <TheWhisper> put side by side
19:55:36 <TheWhisper> and then one's made red
19:55:39 <TheWhisper> and the other cyan
19:55:47 <TheWhisper> so i'm just seeing the normal image in the end
19:55:53 <TheWhisper> because they're the same
19:56:43 <TheWhisper> try setting it to http://i.imgur.com/vW3R5.png
19:56:52 <TheWhisper> and then crossing your eyes until the white dots align
19:56:55 <TheWhisper> you'll see that it don't work

20:53:02 <medos> did you see it already?
20:53:11 <medos> or just the trailer just now?
20:53:13 <EDSGD> No. I just <3 the trailer
20:53:16 <medos> oh
20:53:17 <medos> ok
20:53:24 <EDSGD> Will be watching it.
20:53:30 <medos> don't blame me when any of those movies i mentioned seem boring
20:53:36 <EDSGD> Nice angle and obscure sound
20:53:38 <medos> because you got half of the plot from the trailer
20:53:47 <EDSGD> So.
20:54:02 <medos> you wanted scary movies
20:54:05 <EDSGD> I love things that cool cinematography 
20:54:08 <EDSGD> *has
20:54:25 <EDSGD> CAMERA ANGLES <33333
20:54:26 <medos> the movies i mentioned are all highly recommended
20:54:27 <medos> :P
20:55:01 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKiIroiCvZ0
20:55:39 <EDSGD> Except The Mist
20:56:22 <EDSGD> OOOOOHHHHHHHH
20:56:28 <EDSGD> True Words.
20:56:34 <medos> the mist is good and i know it
20:56:38 <EDSGD> I only watch ignorant things on my phone
20:56:39 <medos> i enjoyed it
20:56:49 <EDSGD> The Old one or the new one?
20:57:24 <medos> 2007
20:58:28 <medos> i enjoyed it
20:58:33 <medos> i would never watch it again
20:58:40 <EDSGD> LIES
20:58:48 <medos> did you watch it?
20:59:48 <medos> if so, you might understand my appreciation for it after seeing X million hollywood horror movies being same old same old
21:00:40 <medos> vacancy
21:01:17 <medos> three extremes
21:01:21 <medos> i think that's about it
21:01:26 <medos> with movies i remember
21:02:19 <medos> sidenote: i try to never watch trailers before watching a movie
21:02:30 <TheWhisper> back
21:02:33 <medos> cabin in the woods blew my mind
21:03:35 <medos> because i did not watch any trailer, excerpt or read reviews
21:03:42 <medos> if i would've it would've had less of an impact
21:03:57 <TheWhisper> I hate horror movies
21:04:07 <medos> EDSGD http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBoEMTtCJnE <- when you're done with eraserhead watch this interview
21:04:11 <TheWhisper> And like
21:04:17 <TheWhisper> I've never seen primer
21:04:20 <TheWhisper> but I've read a ton about it
21:04:25 <TheWhisper> And I feel like that will make it better
21:04:35 <TheWhisper> That's my big experiment though
21:04:46 <TheWhisper> Usually I try not to read about movies beforehand 
21:04:50 <medos> ^
21:04:55 <TheWhisper> And I usually only go by what they show in the first trailer
21:04:59 <medos> i hated primer for an hour
21:05:02 <TheWhisper>  slash rottentomatoes rating
21:05:02 <medos> then it went :O
21:05:11 <medos> *30 minutes rather
21:05:23 <TheWhisper> Rottentomatoes ratings are usually pretty good at predicting my likes/dislikes
21:05:25 <TheWhisper> Though not always
21:05:28 <medos> i don't know i just like to watch movies, not trailers and then movies
21:05:40 <TheWhisper> Have you read The Great Gatsby?
21:05:47 <TheWhisper> Probably not cuz it's such an American book
21:05:59 <TheWhisper> But they're making a movie adaptation of it
21:06:08 <TheWhisper> with Leo Dickaprio 
21:06:14 <medos> awesome
21:06:15 <EDSGD> Its like th 3rd adaption
21:06:21 <TheWhisper> And I'm actually really psyched to see it
21:06:25 <TheWhisper> even though I know the entire plot
21:06:35 <TheWhisper> Simply because I feel like the set design is going to be SO FUCKING GOOD
21:06:41 <TheWhisper> slash art deco

21:07:23 <EDSGD> EEEWWWW they tried to hard with the poster
21:07:32 <EDSGD> and what the fuck 3D?
21:07:41 <TheWhisper> ungggh the poster is so good
21:07:48 <EDSGD> It's awful.
21:07:49 <medos> judging the poster from a 300x200 jpg
21:07:55 <EDSGD> Yes.
21:08:00 <medos> k
21:08:02 <medos> lele
21:08:07 <medos> you judge movies by trailers too
21:08:10 <medos> so that makes sense :P
21:08:20 <EDSGD> Yes.
21:09:01 <TheWhisper> I could've sworn I had a hi res of it
21:09:08 <EDSGD> Smashing of the window
21:09:19 <EDSGD> is gonna look sweet in 3d and the car accident.
21:09:27 <EDSGD> :3
21:10:38 <TheWhisper> Can't find it
21:10:43 <TheWhisper> Eh
21:10:44 <TheWhisper> Fuck that
21:10:48 <TheWhisper> I'm not seeing it in 3D
21:10:51 <TheWhisper> At least not the first time
21:10:55 <TheWhisper> 2D first
21:10:58 <TheWhisper> and then I'll read about the 3D
21:11:01 <TheWhisper> and see if it's any good
21:12:07 <medos> EDSGD what did you think of There Will Be Blood?
21:12:15 <TheWhisper> Great movie
21:12:24 <TheWhisper> Also, I can't find any higher res versions of this poster. Very strange.
21:12:56 <medos> i guess it'll be glossy anyway
21:13:00 <medos> not much help looking at pix
21:13:11 <TheWhisper> Yeah
21:13:12 <TheWhisper> Still
21:13:13 <TheWhisper> ungh
21:13:26 <TheWhisper> And Baz Luhrmann is directing it
21:13:27 <TheWhisper> nggdgdsg
21:13:32 <EDSGD> You mean the movie?
21:13:41 <EDSGD> Or the poster?
21:13:49 <TheWhisper> the movie
21:13:55 <TheWhisper> Yes, he's directing the poster lol

21:21:45 <TheWhisper> these people suckat running
21:23:21 <medos> if you run like you work out
21:23:23 <medos> (21:33:57) (@TheWhisper): okay work out time
21:23:23 <medos> (21:35:17) (@TheWhisper): ow
21:23:30 <medos> you're worse
21:24:20 <TheWhisper> hahaha
21:24:31 <TheWhisper> Well, I meant more that they see a tsunami coming for them
21:24:36 <TheWhisper> and thing "oh i'll film this and run backwards"
21:25:13 <TheWhisper> Also, if the water fucking recedes, you gotta know what that precedes
21:25:29 <medos> doin' it
21:25:56 <TheWhisper> Hm
21:26:01 <TheWhisper> Now I wonder if there's a rhyme in there
21:26:07 <TheWhisper> "When the water recedes, 
21:26:31 <TheWhisper> run, motherfuckeredes"
21:27:20 <TheWhisper> Yeah, also, just watched the Lynch thing
21:27:24 <TheWhisper> I don't get watching things on phones anyway
21:27:27 <TheWhisper> Seems dumb
21:27:33 <TheWhisper> But I also don't get playing games on your phone either
21:27:47 <TheWhisper> So I probably just don't get it because I have a blackberry
21:28:22 <medos> indeed
21:28:35 <medos> your toilet visits are boring and you do not even know it yet
21:29:26 <TheWhisper> Nah, I know that
21:29:30 <TheWhisper> I just read stuff during them
21:29:52 <TheWhisper> If I'm reading an actual book, sometimes I'll just sit there way too long because I'm so engrossed in it lol
21:32:55 <TheWhisper> Really, I enjoy reading more than any other form of entertainment
21:32:57 <TheWhisper> hm
21:34:51 <medos> not my impression
21:35:50 <EDSGD> President Obama uses a Blackberry
21:39:39 <medos> .gis obama reddit
21:40:09 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/ITuKy.png
21:40:11 <EDSGD> It runs Windows
21:40:34 <EDSGD> WTF What am I suppose to be seeing?
21:41:04 <medos> .gis obama blackberry
21:41:10 <TheWhisper> Medos, the reason that is not your impression is 1) if I'm reading, I'm not on here
21:41:23 <TheWhisper> 2) I generally don't talk about what I'm reading with people who haven't also read those same things
21:41:46 <TheWhisper> 3) I haven't read much over the past 2 months simply because /I enjoy reading too much/
21:41:56 <TheWhisper> And once I start, I hyperfocus in on it
21:42:00 <TheWhisper> (if it's a good book, at least)
21:42:09 <TheWhisper> and next thing I know, it's 4 AM and I'm almost done
21:42:13 <EDSGD> The Hunger Games
21:42:16 <TheWhisper> ^ shit
21:42:23 <TheWhisper> Read Battle Royale
21:42:27 <TheWhisper> Much better
21:42:39 <EDSGD> :D
21:42:46 <TheWhisper> Comparison: Battle Royal > Hunger Games
21:42:47 <TheWhisper> But
21:42:52 <TheWhisper> Battle Royale by itself?
21:42:52 <TheWhisper> Eh
21:43:33 <TheWhisper> Medos, I'll take a picture of my bookshelves when I get home

22:02:39 <Kocho> ah ok

22:02:49 <Kocho> looks good though
22:02:53 <TheWhisper> Suhweet
22:03:00 <Kocho> but like i said, never ridden/rode a 29er
22:03:03 <TheWhisper> Peachplum, student, professional, or freelancer?
22:03:05 <TheWhisper> 29er?
22:03:10 <Kocho> but they're in fashion att the moment
22:03:13 <Kocho> at*
22:03:25 <Kocho> mountain bike with bigger wheels*
22:03:27 <TheWhisper> Ah
22:03:35 <TheWhisper> Yeah, well, I think it'll be good
22:03:39 <TheWhisper> Assuming we have a harsh winter
22:03:40 <Kocho> yeah i think so too
22:04:16 <Kocho> Fuji are a well known brand… usually at a entry / mid level
22:04:22 <TheWhisper> Okay
22:04:31 <Kocho> know if it's got hydraulic brakes?
22:04:33 <TheWhisper> Nope
22:04:45 <TheWhisper> One thing I was worried was that it's a 17" frame
22:04:55 <Kocho> ah ok
22:05:03 <Kocho> yeah that's probably a bit small
22:05:11 <TheWhisper> (PeachPlum, don't worry - you're not in the wrong channel. :P)
22:05:19 <Kocho> but its tough to know because everyones different
22:05:24 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I figured I'd see what the boss says anyway
22:05:25 <Kocho> just make sure you feel comfortable
22:05:31 <TheWhisper> I'm sure he knows more than the kid who was there
22:05:36 <Kocho> ok
22:10:02 <TheWhisper> Also, Kocho, wanna see my site? I think I have the main page and stuff pretty much done
22:10:09 <Kocho> yeah for sure
22:10:12 <TheWhisper> Not live though

22:10:46 <PeachPlum> I'm sorry! I stepped away from my computer.
22:11:05 <TheWhisper> No worries :)
22:11:13 <PeachPlum> I am a fresh grad and was actually wondering if I could get some advice from others from here.
22:11:33 <TheWhisper> We'll try haha
22:11:40 <TheWhisper> You have a site?
22:11:57 <PeachPlum> Yes. http://www.kaylabonzo.com
22:12:03 <Kocho> no way
22:12:06 <TheWhisper> bonzooo
22:12:09 <Kocho> someone actually has a site!
22:12:20 <TheWhisper> :P
22:12:33 <PeachPlum> shhh, thats my last name, heh. Its weird
22:12:33 <TheWhisper> Damn, loving the LoL illustration
22:12:58 <PeachPlum> Thank you, I posted it on the League subreddit before. :)
22:13:35 <TheWhisper> Um
22:13:46 <TheWhisper> Your photos all look very low res though
22:13:55 <TheWhisper> like you upsized them after saving
22:14:03 <TheWhisper> Ah
22:14:03 <TheWhisper> I see
22:14:26 <PeachPlum> Thats weird, I'll have to go fix that.
22:14:49 <medos> So many people!
22:14:49 <TheWhisper> I think that what it may be
22:14:50 <medos> hi
22:14:51 <TheWhisper> is that
22:15:07 <TheWhisper> hm
22:15:13 <PeachPlum> Im actually planning a complete site and logo rehaul, I don't really like what I have right now.
22:15:23 <Kocho> medos, hi, student / professional / freelancer 
22:15:28 <TheWhisper> I don't know actually. The size you've specified in the html is the exact size of the image
22:15:45 <TheWhisper> And when I right click > view image, it looks sharp and crisp
22:15:49 <medos> whoa
22:16:00 <TheWhisper> It could be http://i.imgur.com/NZic8.png that
22:16:01 <TheWhisper> idk though
22:16:04 <PeachPlum> Maybe its Wordpress?
22:16:38 <TheWhisper> Lemme just make sure it's not firefox acting up
22:17:06 <TheWhisper> Nope, happens in chrome too
22:17:07 <medos> Looks fine to me.
22:17:38 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/KUFmj.png is how it looks for me
22:17:53 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/JiiCd.png is how the image alone looks
22:18:03 <PeachPlum> Thank you Medos
22:18:04 <medos> hi Kocho professional freelancer educating students in his free time is what I am, how about you?
22:18:29 <PeachPlum> Actually I see what you are seeing Whisper
22:18:35 <TheWhisper> I think it's that width: 100% in your CSS
22:18:35 <Kocho> ms paint hobbiest
22:18:41 <PeachPlum> I'll have to figure this out.
22:18:50 <TheWhisper> Your stuff is cool though :P
22:18:54 <PeachPlum> That kinda goes in hand with what I was wanting to ask for advice about.
22:19:01 <TheWhisper> Damn, really nice Hare too
22:19:09 <Kocho> it is width 100%
22:19:11 <medos> PeachPlum awesome stuff in there, I'll look at your pieces in a bit ;)
22:19:18 <Kocho> thats pixellating the images
22:19:21 <PeachPlum> I don't really know web design, I only learned purely print and illustration.
22:19:37 <PeachPlum> And I'm haveing trouble finding work because of it.
22:19:45 <TheWhisper> Ah
22:20:02 <PeachPlum> Is web design something I should try to learn on my own or should I go back to school for it?
22:20:12 -!- Rachen [~Rachen@65.129.139.44] has joined ##reddit-gd
22:20:15 <TheWhisper> I think it's definitely something one can learn on their own
22:20:23 <TheWhisper> If they take the time to do so
22:20:53 <TheWhisper> And, in some cases, I think people may be better off doing it themselves, as school curriculae are often behind the times.
22:21:22 <TheWhisper> *curriculum
22:21:45 <PeachPlum> Alright, how should I go about it then? Pick up some books or certain websites?
22:21:57 <medos> ?wordpress
22:22:00 <PeachPlum> I took one basic class my senior year, I didn't do very well in it.
22:22:01 <medos> ?webdesign
22:22:02 <TheWhisper> Medos, has some great resources
22:22:07 <TheWhisper> ^
22:22:13 <TheWhisper> He made that post 
22:22:31 <medos> That's a post full of designer-goes-frontend-webdev-content
22:22:37 <PeachPlum> nice, thanks
22:22:42 <medos> ?freelance
22:22:43 <TheWhisper> and I think a good book for learning basic HTML / CSS is http://htmlandcssbook.com/
22:22:51 <medos> ^ For troubles finding work
22:23:35 <PeachPlum> Thank you
22:24:11 <TheWhisper> We're always glad to help
22:24:21 <medos> Yeah :)
22:24:24 <TheWhisper> brb making dinner
22:24:29 <TheWhisper> medos look at pm 
22:24:48 <PeachPlum> Is there anything that sticks out in my portfolio that I should work on? (Besides the awful resolution, I'm working on that right now :P)
22:25:40 <medos> hmmm
22:26:16 <medos> That really really depends on what kind of clients you're looking for
22:26:28 <medos> In my opinion it's an awesome collection of work
22:27:35 <medos> Do you mind if i ask how you go about finding clients?
22:28:46 <PeachPlum> Well, to be honest I don't feel confident on doing freelance work right now, I've been  applying to design firms and businesses looking for inhouse designers. But I'm under experienced for a lot of places.
22:29:18 <medos> says who? :P
22:29:20 <PeachPlum> The few freelance projects I have done have mostly been by found by word of mouth from teachers and friends.
22:29:46 <medos> ok, sounds like a start
22:30:36 <medos> (sorry if i'm not instantly replying, kinda doing 2-3 things at once)
22:30:56 <Kocho> PeachPlum get rid of width: 100% line 66 in custom.css
22:31:12 <PeachPlum> Pretty much every where I've applied. ._. They either want folks with lots of experience, like 5+ or if they want still in school kids for their internships.
22:31:18 <PeachPlum> Alright Kocho. Thanks!
22:32:20 <medos> http://kaylabonzo.com/2012/05/ivory-pawn/ <- get rid of these mockups
22:32:25 <medos> ?psd
22:32:38 <EDSGD> Damn these stock photos. How can you be happy looking at meat packaging
22:32:40 <medos> http://www.psdcovers.com/
22:33:31 <medos> I think these are free product templates
22:33:58 <medos> which would give a more corporate vibe
22:34:20 <medos> *replace them
22:34:22 <medos> I mean
22:34:24 <TheWhisper>  Back
22:34:32 <PeachPlum> Oh these are nice!
22:35:23 <medos> you just need a Creativecommons Attribution on your website
22:35:43 <medos> worth trading a small attribution for more realistic mockups
22:36:07 <TheWhisper> Unless the packaging was part of the brand
22:36:13 <TheWhisper> Then maybe remake it 
22:36:19 <TheWhisper> but otherwise, I agree with medos
22:37:17 <medos> as cheesy as it may sound: standard looking mockups will put the focus on your design/logo/content
22:38:23 <PeachPlum> Ah, makes sense.
22:38:43 <medos> your cup/box are heavily shaded right now
22:38:52 <medos> i'm looking more at the cup than the logo on it
22:40:09 <TheWhisper> PeachPlum, did you do the entire LoL illustration in PS, or did you sketch & scan?
22:41:12 <PeachPlum> In Photoshop, my scanner is dead. :(
22:41:18 <TheWhisper> Nice
22:41:30 <TheWhisper> .tell edsgd http://www.cracktwo.com/2011/04/25-abandoned-soviet-monuments-that-look.html
22:42:25 <TheWhisper> PeachPlum, have you used IRC before?
22:43:00 <PeachPlum> Its been a looong while.
22:43:25 <medos> feel free to stay and ask random questions from time to time ;)
22:43:29 <TheWhisper> Yeah

23:00:23 <EDSGD> I love your humor medos http://i.minus.com/jbcpU7PIWc2yQF.png

23:05:13 <medos> foobar
23:05:33 <TheWhisper> Why foobar over the music app?
23:06:08 <medos> because the windows 8 preview music app was unusable

23:13:51 <TheWhisper> Pretty much anywhere :
23:13:52 <TheWhisper> :P
23:14:01 <TheWhisper> Depends on what specifically you're looking for inspiration on
23:14:19 <PeachPlum> I like Logo pond :D
23:14:32 <TheWhisper> They're not bad
23:15:30 <Kocho> logopond is ok
23:15:40 <TheWhisper> ?inspiration
23:15:41 <Kocho> i find that it's a bit average now
23:15:47 <TheWhisper> hm
23:15:48 <Kocho> i still like logo books
23:15:53 <TheWhisper> ?resources
23:16:05 <medos> huh
23:16:07 <TheWhisper> I could've sworn there was an inspiration thing there
23:16:19 <TheWhisper> Medos, didn't you make a post on inspiration recently
23:16:46 <medos> i made plenty of those on reddit
23:16:55 <medos> ?looking
23:18:30 <TheWhisper> That's not inspiring ;)
23:18:30 <TheWhisper> jk

23:22:38 <TheWhisper> Ah, cool
23:23:09 <TheWhisper> Well, we have some guys in here who know how to use AE
23:23:13 <TheWhisper> I personally don't
23:23:42 <TheWhisper> I'm also still really hungry, so brb
23:24:15 <superbgoblin> Well its takes time to learn.
23:24:45 <Kocho> cs6 indesign, do you guys have High Quality Print as a PDF export option?
23:25:05 <medos> define HQ
23:25:24 <Kocho> it was an option in cs5,4,3,2,1,0,-1,-2
23:25:25 <medos> 300dpi?
23:25:38 <Kocho> yeah 300dpi
23:25:39 <Kocho> but
23:25:41 <EDSGD> File > Adobe PDF.... > Press Quality 
23:25:43 <EDSGD> ?????
23:25:45 <Kocho> it wasn't x1a
23:26:06 <Kocho> yeah i don't even have press quality there
23:26:11 <medos> uhhhh
23:26:17 <Kocho> is High Quality Print there EDSGD?
23:26:21 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Q6JGD.png
23:26:28 <medos> there's no "high" quality in print
23:26:39 <medos> you have losless vectors and eps data for gradients colors
23:26:41 <medos> and images
23:26:51 <medos> at a fixed dpi setting
23:27:00 <Kocho> 1 sec
23:27:34 <medos> File -> Adobe PDF Presets -> High Quality Print
23:27:36 <medos> is what i see
23:27:43 <Kocho> yeah so it is there
23:27:45 <Kocho> hrmm
23:27:52 <Kocho> why don't i have those options
23:28:35 <medos> to save you from thinking there's a printing press somewhere that has a high medium and low quality print button
23:28:43 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/rizht.png
23:28:53 <medos> :P
23:28:56 <Kocho> grr, yeah i don't have those
23:28:59 <Kocho> or 2008
23:29:06 <Kocho> just have 1a and 3
23:29:30 <Kocho> i guess i can import those options from cs5
23:29:44 <PeachPlum> I have to go and make dinner. I'll start comeing here more often though, everyone is really nice and helpful!
23:29:45 <medos> i would recommend looking at the settings for each
23:29:51 <PeachPlum> Later!
23:30:02 <superbgoblin> What subredit would be appropiate to post your own creations?
