05:19:28 <IAmLegend> I'm not sure if he's trolling or serious
05:20:04 <medos> no idea, it's one of the reasons i'm dodging ##design though
05:20:24 <IAmLegend> 'cause of hugo?

13:37:11 <somebear> is Awesomius the new arrow bot?
13:37:32 <thearrowflies_> i guess so
13:37:39 <thearrowflies_> arrowbot was banned
13:37:42 <thearrowflies_> for some reason
13:38:08 <somebear> banned from where?
13:38:13 <thearrowflies> this channel
13:38:25 <somebear> wasn't it opped at some point?
13:38:30 <thearrowflies> yup
13:38:34 <somebear> hm
13:38:50 <medos> it was
13:39:04 <somebear> not much speaking between the ops? someone banned something that had ops, why, dunno?
13:39:12 <medos> lolol
13:39:32 <EDSGD> le
13:39:34 <medos> major problem being the bot having commands
13:39:40 <medos> timebomb
13:39:45 <medos> .list
13:39:56 <thearrowflies> d_d
13:39:56 <medos> ...
13:40:00 <somebear> ?
13:40:01 <medos> so many triggers
13:40:04 <medos> that were unintended
13:40:15 <thearrowflies> ive been meaning to fix ...
13:40:16 <thearrowflies> ...
13:40:31 <medos> you can still do that?
13:40:35 <medos> if an irc novice/someone who never used irc joins
13:40:52 <medos> and a bot throws random commands just because he types something
13:40:54 <EDSGD> me
13:40:57 <thearrowflies> it seems like your assuming that someone who joins irc for the first time will be an idiot
13:41:04 <EDSGD> me
13:41:49 <somebear> medos: there is a web irc link in the sidebar of /r/graphic_design...
13:41:52 <medos> i asked you tenty times to tune it down, you told me it's fine like it is and users should adapt and i should teach users to not be annoying and spam stuff and when i asked you to to teach people you did not want to
13:42:22 <medos> so you said the problem solves itself
13:42:24 <medos> so i banned it
13:42:28 <medos> that's all
13:42:39 <medos> if you're not willing to fix stuff i do so
13:42:50 <thearrowflies> you gave the bomb example, i removed the giant ascii thing. its one line now. i didnt need to 'teach' anyone anything, if you didnt want whisper bombing people then you should have told him not to use it
13:42:57 <medos> i don't care
13:43:08 <medos> enough
13:43:09 <medos> to argue
13:43:18 <EDSGD> later
13:43:22 <medos> bye

13:45:36 <somebear> or lazy ass-designers
13:46:18 <somebear> btw, how come this channel is ##reddit-gd instead of #reddit-gd?
13:46:27 <medos> freenode rules
13:46:50 <medos> if you're an employee of conde nast there's #reddit-gd
13:46:55 <medos> to run
13:46:57 <medos> if not there's not
13:47:16 <somebear> really, never heard that rule before
13:48:11 <medos> read up :-P
13:49:16 <medos> http://freenode.net/policy.shtml#primarychannels
13:49:25 <medos> Or click that link.
13:49:37 <somebear> basically it says that the primary channel (those with a single #) can be claimed by organizations, but there's nothing preventing you from registrering one
13:50:59 <somebear> »are reserved for participating groups and organizations based on their legal or informal claim to the associated name or name prefix«
13:51:31 <somebear> emphasis on participating.

13:54:50 <medos> thearrowflies sorry that i banned your bot but its behaviour has been unchanged for weeks after asking for several times
13:55:04 <thearrowflies> ? im not angry
13:55:15 <thearrowflies> i understand what you are saying
13:55:27 <thearrowflies> but, i just feel like some things arent a problem/easily fixed
13:55:29 <medos> i'm just tired of arguing about bots
13:55:31 <medos> yeah
13:55:48 <medos> if it's fixed up it can go on Azra-el's server
13:55:56 <medos> the separate version
13:56:11 <thearrowflies> i told him to go get it
13:56:17 <thearrowflies> he said he was too lazy or something

13:58:35 <thearrowflies> If you can put up with it till azra fixes it then id be happy to. Theres a user in another chan that has aspergers and he really likes it
13:58:40 <thearrowflies> and i dont want to upset him
13:59:15 <medos> i don't mind anymore
13:59:30 <medos> i decided to ask you to let him join in here without asking anyone

14:38:16 <TheWhisper> and polychlorinated biphenyls are banned

14:39:25 <TheWhisper> http://i.min.us/i2e9SLKN3DjFJ.png
14:39:33 <TheWhisper> I hate when people ban things for being 'choking hazards.'
14:39:41 <TheWhisper> Just fucking trust in parents 
14:39:48 <TheWhisper> and if 2 or 3 kids die because their parents are idiots
14:39:58 <TheWhisper> then that's just how the cookie crumbles
14:40:06 <TheWhisper> doesn't mean we should ban things for everyone
14:40:15 <medos> BAN CONDOMS
14:40:17 <marshmallow> i wouldn't give a kiddie that if they're 2 or 3
14:40:18 <medos> oh wait

15:04:44 <TheWhisper> Now that I think about it though, I feel like I've seem some fantasy characters modeled after them
15:04:56 <medos> marshmallow it's just that some popular iphone apps are being made for android too after a while , i'm just not sure if they're any good on android
15:05:07 <medos> but if you don't use flipboard i'm out of apps to ask about
15:05:38 <marshmallow> I don't use a lot of apps

16:23:30 <TheWhisper> ish
16:24:39 <TheWhisper> okay
16:24:44 <TheWhisper> I have a general idea what it is
16:25:12 <medos> mkv too?
16:25:46 <TheWhisper> sort of
16:26:04 <TheWhisper> it's just like a container that can hold multiple types of data
16:26:07 <EDSGD> seeing her struggle. she learns more :D
16:26:17 <EDSGD> I mean quicker 
16:26:44 <TheWhisper> medos is yv12 the same as yuy2?
16:26:57 <TheWhisper> nvm dumb question
16:28:42 <TheWhisper> oh
16:28:46 <TheWhisper> I just changed the renderer
16:28:47 <medos> oh!
16:28:48 <TheWhisper> and it works fine now

16:30:10 <TheWhisper> "None of the EVR mixer filters work on RGB-like input."
16:30:16 <TheWhisper> so
16:30:32 <TheWhisper> that would probaably be why it didn't work with EVR Custom Presenter renderer

16:34:46 <TheWhisper> medos
16:35:01 <TheWhisper> do you think the problem was that the video couldn't be decoded quickly enough?
16:35:07 <TheWhisper> using that renderer?
16:35:54 <EDSGD> and no  I used my internet ignorant account
16:36:02 <medos> lol
16:36:04 <TheWhisper> Especially because it has http://i.min.us/iB2Bzfyfm00L5.png
16:36:08 <TheWhisper> which are settings only for that renderer
16:36:12 <TheWhisper> so maybe that's it

19:05:51 <marshmallow> depends how well you know em
19:06:27 <medos> ze German was wondering if Congratulations on marriage or getting married or best wishes to you and your now-wife or anything else would be seen as usual friend-like email introduction
19:06:56 <marshmallow> something like... Congrats on getting married.   You guys are so perfect together!  I wish you many years of happiness.
19:07:02 <TheWhisper> Why weren't you at the wedding?
19:07:12 <TheWhisper> If they didn't invite you, doesn't sound like a good enough friend to email

19:07:23 <TheWhisper> skype him

20:25:53 <TheWhisper> okay class time
20:25:54 <TheWhisper> later
20:25:56 <TheWhisper> ;)
20:26:22 <medos> is something like that cringeworthy or creepy?
20:26:25 <medos> i can't judge
20:32:43 <marshmallow> medossssssssss...  i just did a mturk that made me use http://www.bingiton.com/Landingpage.aspx
20:32:59 <marshmallow> stupid bing
20:34:02 <medos> (20:15:10) (medos): try the bingiton thing
20:34:06 <medos> (20:15:28) (marshmallow): no
20:34:11 <medos> (20:15:31) (marshmallow): i hate bing
20:34:43 <medos> I'm being ignored.
20:35:01 <medos> 5 mturk cent though and you're trying it.
20:35:04 <medos> hahaha :(
20:35:14 <marshmallow> gah damn it
20:35:30 <marshmallow> i had 1-draw, 2-bing, 2-google
20:35:32 <medos> be honest
20:35:36 <medos> AH!
20:35:51 <marshmallow> NO ME GUSTA
20:36:09 <medos> lol
20:36:14 <marshmallow> i'm gonna try again with harder stuff...
20:36:27 <medos> if shit repeats
20:36:45 <medos> and bingiton is currently trendy
20:36:52 <medos> you will use it more than once
20:36:53 <medos> haha
20:37:43 <medos> i never finished it, will start over in a browser where my search results aren't clicked-color
20:39:26 <marshmallow> interestingly...  4/5 this time for google
20:39:46 <marshmallow> this time i tried being more specific...  basically looking for locations/restaurants 
20:39:52 <marshmallow> instead of generic stuff like movies
20:40:54 <medos> stuff you know
20:41:07 <marshmallow> yea
20:41:12 <marshmallow> so i know what i'm looking for
20:41:19 <marshmallow> like addresses / hours
20:41:24 <marshmallow> google won
20:41:45 <medos> that's the sickest marketing technique i've seen in a long time though
20:41:57 <medos> microsoft is checking where bing is still failing
20:42:03 <medos> and adapts
20:42:11 <marshmallow> i guess
20:42:18 <marshmallow> i still hate bing
20:42:21 <medos> + you earned mturk
20:42:26 <marshmallow> though, it does rank my webbie higher
20:42:27 <marshmallow> grr
20:42:28 <medos> yay hooray
20:42:55 <marshmallow> i don't think i'm gonna get the mturk money
20:43:01 <marshmallow> i think i did it too fast.  woops XD
20:44:43 <medos> once more please
20:49:49 <marshmallow> once more what?
20:51:33 <medos> the bing thing p
20:51:34 <medos> haha
20:51:44 <medos> or are you not allowed to repeat tests?
20:53:34 <marshmallow> ooh, 
20:53:40 <marshmallow> no i don't think i can repeat it
20:53:47 <marshmallow> i accidentally submitted it too early
20:54:21 <marshmallow> which isn't good since it'll hurt my stats
20:54:29 <marshmallow> so i'll be less likely to do others in the future =(
20:54:45 <marshmallow> but you can make semi-decent money mturking when bored
20:55:29 <medos> :P

23:13:01 <gethaased> well this has been fun. What time are people generally here.. chatting?
23:14:06 <gethaased> I was expecting a lot more adobe bashing, starbucks fanclub pixel art with a hint of helvetica
23:17:16 <EDSGD> wow
23:17:23 <EDSGD> we're none of that
23:17:25 <thearrowflies> lolololol

23:17:37 <EDSGD> its mixed,
23:17:48 <EDSGD> It was busy a few hours ago,
23:17:49 <gethaased> I'm looking like the one guy who paid for Creative Suite in a wash of BFA graduate students... hrmm 
23:18:11 <gethaased> those are the best ice breakers I've got...
23:18:56 <gethaased> and I really did want the Adobe bashing :(
23:19:09 <gethaased> such as, why does Photoshop finally get crash recovery, and no other CS?
23:19:37 <gethaased> How can Adobe still not figure out how to make synonymous keyboard shortcuts across applications?
23:20:04 <gethaased> Why does Dreamweaver still look as clunky and horrific as it did when it was run by Macromedia
23:20:18 <gethaased> And who in their right mind actually uses Fireworks? Can't we have ImageReady back already
23:22:58 <EDSGD> Because we're r/graphicdesign
