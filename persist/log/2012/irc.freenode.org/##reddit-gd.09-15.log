01:35:21 <TheWhisper> Finese Choods
01:35:54 <TheWhisper> Jon LaJoie is hilarious
01:35:58 <TheWhisper> He's amazing in The League
01:36:36 <EDSGD> just the first season right
01:36:48 <EDSGD> i thought the second season was weak
01:37:17 <EDSGD> Shows that seem to try hard are abig turn off 
01:37:29 <EDSGD> e.g WEEDS
01:39:44 <Kocho> eg
01:39:47 <Kocho> working on the weekend
01:40:05 <TheWhisper> Second season is good
01:40:10 <TheWhisper> but definitely not as strong as the firts
01:40:12 <TheWhisper> first
01:41:54 <EDSGD> I forgot my belt again today
01:41:58 <EDSGD> I felt weird
01:42:09 <Kocho> =[
01:44:44 <Kocho> do you think its safe
01:44:54 <Kocho> if i 'drop' certain tables within phpmyadmin
01:45:02 <Kocho> which i don't believe i'm using?
01:45:19 <EDSGD> i dont know man
01:45:20 <Kocho> sounds safe doesn't it?
01:45:24 <Kocho> what do you think
01:45:32 <Kocho> even if you don't know
01:45:37 <EDSGD> make a back up then try it 
01:45:43 <EDSGD> then it sounds safe
01:45:44 <Kocho> i don't know how
01:45:52 <EDSGD> me neither
01:45:57 <Kocho> gah
01:45:58 <Kocho> lol
01:46:15 <EDSGD> what are you using it for
01:47:03 <EDSGD> Hey guys let me tell you a little story
01:47:12 <Kocho> i want to hear!
01:47:16 <EDSGD> so today 90 degree weather
01:47:31 <EDSGD> I take public transportation in LA
01:47:50 <EDSGD> dense population
01:48:04 <EDSGD> so you can imagine how packed trains might get
01:48:31 <EDSGD> An accident happens. Train and car collide
01:49:00 <EDSGD> so train stops and we have to get out and wait for another.
01:49:13 <Kocho> fair enough
01:49:18 <EDSGD> Now they are being delayed because of the accident
01:49:25 <Kocho> ok
01:49:39 <EDSGD> wait time + people = more people
01:50:01 <EDSGD> 90 degree weather packed in a train like sardines.
01:50:13 <EDSGD> It smells everyone is touching each other 
01:50:22 <EDSGD> children
01:50:30 <EDSGD> horrible
01:51:06 <EDSGD> took me 3 hours to reach my destination rather than the usual 1:15- 30 hrs trip
01:51:12 <Kocho> yeah
01:51:18 <Kocho> but the train had an accident
01:51:28 <Kocho> how do you think the drivers feel?
01:51:59 <EDSGD> Pissed off I bet.
01:52:11 <EDSGD> First world problem?
01:52:27 <Kocho> sounds like a more than first world problem
01:52:44 <Kocho> i think the drivers don't feel pissed off, i reckon they might be in a bit of shock?
01:52:49 <Kocho> perhaps a bit sore?
01:52:51 <Kocho> maybe dead?
01:53:03 <EDSGD> but its la
01:53:04 <Kocho> severly injured? 
01:53:14 <EDSGD> I don't know.
01:53:26 <Kocho> but it's LA?
01:53:30 <EDSGD> LOl yeah
01:53:31 <Kocho> what do you mean by that?
01:53:53 <EDSGD> Cops killing people point blank a few months agi
01:54:06 <EDSGD> earlier this week some man ran over a person
01:54:12 <Kocho> oh
01:54:14 <EDSGD> closed off an intersection
01:54:20 <Kocho> so its a bit off a who cares situation
01:54:25 <Kocho> america is a lovely place
01:54:25 <EDSGD> Yeah
01:54:40 <EDSGD> Gun shots in the alley
01:54:59 <Kocho> USA get some gun laws and it'd be a better place
01:55:08 <EDSGD> you have to take into consideration the population
01:55:14 <Kocho> i have
01:55:45 <EDSGD> LOL seriously today
01:56:01 <EDSGD> when I got off my stop some man was selling drugs in the open lol
01:56:14 <EDSGD> no one really cared
01:56:45 <EDSGD> :p
01:56:55 <EDSGD> Probably making it sound like a horrible place
01:56:58 <Kocho> but its ok 'cause the US has a large population
02:00:12 <TheWhisper> what the fuck is this shit
02:00:13 <TheWhisper> http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/4859/screenshots/476948/attachments/31142/large(1).png
02:00:21 <TheWhisper> it doesn't even make sense
02:01:04 <EDSGD> They are albums TheWhisper
02:01:10 <EDSGD> c'mon you should know that
02:01:17 <TheWhisper> impossible albums
02:01:18 <Kocho> not good enough
02:01:21 <TheWhisper> it's like some escher shit
02:01:53 <EDSGD> Remember that article for Fastcodesigaksdajksdhajsh about how much they want them to look real

04:44:00 <EDSGD> Hey is anyone awake at the moment?
04:46:39 <zakmac> Yes, EDSGD 
04:47:30 <EDSGD> Oh wow. Its been a while since I've seen you active on here. I'm honored.
04:47:47 <zakmac> Oh you're making me blush
04:47:51 <EDSGD> Anyway. zakmac do you use software or addons for downloading
04:47:55 <EDSGD> ;D
04:48:22 <zakmac> Transmission, sometimes uTorrent but nothing for a browser since Chrome has a decent built in d/l manager
04:48:30 <EDSGD> Reason I'm asking is because I'm directly downloading a file right now 
04:48:43 <EDSGD> I'm not doing torrents.
04:49:02 <zakmac> Yeah… uh, me either...
04:49:05 <EDSGD> 300mb and it'll suck if it stops.
04:49:16 <zakmac> What browser/FTP client?
04:49:37 <EDSGD> Firefox and not doing FTP
04:49:40 <zakmac> Also 300mb is tiny these days, it's something like 5 minutes of waiting
04:49:53 <EDSGD> I don't have your special internet :p
04:50:18 <zakmac> I'm currently (not) downloading 3GB of movies and they'll all (not) be done within the next 10 minutes
04:50:31 <EDSGD> WTF
04:50:37 <EDSGD> Is this home internet?
04:50:46 <EDSGD> Who's your provider?
04:50:53 <EDSGD> Download speed?
04:51:02 <EDSGD> So many questions to be answered.
04:51:09 <EDSGD> ;3
04:51:12 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/ddDHt.png
04:51:33 <zakmac> Comcast, I think. My roommate pays the bill so I dunno
04:51:37 <EDSGD> LOL
04:51:48 <zakmac> I just shove $50 in her face once a month
04:52:08 <EDSGD> 2.26 MB and  you're downloading 3GB in 10 minutes?
04:52:13 <EDSGD> I call bullshit.
04:52:23 <zakmac> No, its been running for ~15 minutes already
04:52:52 <EDSGD> Oh nevermind
04:52:57 <zakmac> http://imgur.com/r2N2V
04:52:59 <EDSGD> We have the same speed.
04:53:10 <zakmac> Safe will speed up once Butter and Chernobyl are done
04:53:43 <EDSGD> FUCK and all at once
04:53:48 <EDSGD> I'm so jelous.
04:54:10 <zakmac> Every time I go to hd-trailers.net I end up on a download spree
04:54:26 <EDSGD> I would too.
04:54:40 <EDSGD> I'm a digital hoarder
04:54:55 <zakmac> Motherfuck this Butter file is a stupid dupe to get Windows users to download malware
04:55:13 <zakmac> Stupid public trackers
04:55:19 <EDSGD> LOL
04:55:21 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/o20GP.png
04:55:25 <EDSGD> I'm careful. :D
04:55:36 <EDSGD> HAHAHA
04:55:59 <EDSGD> I'm remember when I was younger and extremely naive
04:56:17 <EDSGD> I would believe and download it. I've grown since then. :D
04:56:49 <zakmac> I was guilty, back in the days of Imesh and Kazaa movie downloads
04:57:24 <EDSGD> Yes. I'm downloading something from GoMedia since I couldn't find it on torrents so I had to resort to shit like 4shared. Downspeeds are horrendous.
04:58:19 <EDSGD> Wow, I'm awed
04:58:25 <EDSGD> . I swear.
04:59:24 <zakmac> Yeah those *share/upload sites are always so slow
05:00:38 <EDSGD> Yeah and then looking for the *real download link. Annoying.
05:02:13 <EDSGD> By the way I stalk you. Hope you don't mind. http://www.zakmac.com/
05:02:20 <EDSGD> ;3
05:02:34 <zakmac> I don't follow
05:03:51 <EDSGD> Nevermind. I was just trying to be creepy and in a way impress you.
05:04:25 <zakmac> Color me impressed
05:04:32 <zakmac> Wanna see a painting I'm working on?
05:04:45 <EDSGD> You paint too?
05:04:53 <zakmac> Poorly
05:04:59 <EDSGD> Sure shoot 
05:05:03 <zakmac> Working on a grizzly bear
05:05:13 <EDSGD> shitty_watercolour
05:06:13 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/u2NB3.jpg
05:06:35 <zakmac> I stole a couple roadblock signs from a construction site nearby so I'd have something to paint on
05:07:43 <EDSGD> Man of hidden talents.
05:08:00 <zakmac> Thievery and painting
05:08:13 <zakmac> Hopefully when its done he will look angry/awesome
05:09:35 <EDSGD> It looks cute
05:10:57 <EDSGD> And you don't paint poorly by the way.
05:11:05 <EDSGD> Let me see if I can find one of mines.

06:03:08 <EDSGD> LAME.
06:03:18 <EDSGD> Turns out I downloaded the wrong thing
06:03:20 <EDSGD> :(
06:03:29 <zakmac> Hah
06:03:41 <zakmac> Now you can find the right file only to learn you've hit that site's 24 hour limit
06:07:42 <EDSGD> I hope not.
06:08:28 <zakmac> That'd happen on Rapidshare a lot. Download 2/3 of a movie's far files and hit either the download amount or file number limit
06:09:29 <EDSGD> I have to wait 3 hours
06:09:33 <EDSGD> =-o
06:11:30 <TheWhisper> fuuuck

06:17:10 <zakmac> Chernobyl Diaries was a disappointment
06:17:49 <EDSGD> I agree. Rotten Tomatoes told me so.
06:18:00 <EDSGD> Watch "Cabin in the woods"
06:18:31 <zakmac> Saw it in theaters. It was surprisingly awesome
06:18:42 <zakmac> I'd even mildly support a sequel 
06:21:18 <EDSGD> A sequel. Crazy talk.
06:22:26 <zakmac> You saw all those crazy monster
06:22:38 <zakmac> Zombie Jesus freaks were cool and all, but c'mon
06:23:53 <EDSGD> Yeah it was awesome and funny.
06:23:57 <EDSGD> The Unicorn.

06:26:42 <EDSGD> Of course. How silly of me.

22:18:46 <EDSGD_> Question: When you guys talk about yourself do you talk about yourself in third person?
22:19:03 <medos> no
22:19:09 <medos> why
22:19:10 <medos> lol
22:20:05 <EDSGD_> I was just curious. I talk about me in third person and some guy mentioned that it sounds weird.
22:20:26 <EDSGD_> In person of course. rarely on the net.
22:23:09 <medos> example!
22:28:28 <EDSGD_> You know Edward won't be going to prison for murder or rape, but instead he'll be there for theft.
22:28:52 <EDSGD_> Pretend you heard your friend say that even though he's referring to himself.
22:29:14 <EDSGD_> Its fun.
22:29:21 <EDSGD_> and I enjoy doing it.
22:30:50 <EDSGD_> *le
22:38:55 <medos> le

23:08:12 <TheWhisper> http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/09/william-gibson-part-3-punk-memes/ Gibson has a really interesting view on punk
23:08:28 <TheWhisper> He thinks it was the last pre-digital counterculture and we won't see anything like it again
23:08:46 <medos> i agree
23:10:13 <TheWhisper> Me too
23:10:19 <TheWhisper> There's too much and too many
23:10:31 <TheWhisper> So everything ends up getting subsumed
23:10:46 <TheWhisper> And nothing is given time to grow and spread on its own merits
23:11:56 <TheWhisper> Also, I don't get the big deal about 'Gangnam style'
23:12:05 <TheWhisper> It's no different than Barbara Streisand
23:12:06 <TheWhisper> or 
23:12:09 <TheWhisper> Like a G6
23:14:33 <medos> Does it float though?
23:15:28 <TheWhisper> Or I'm on a boat
23:21:27 <medos> I'm wondering how Gangwhateer Style is no different from Barbara Streisand.
23:25:46 <TheWhisper> idk
