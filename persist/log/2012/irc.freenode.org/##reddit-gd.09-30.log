03:02:05 <adding_confusion> :( yeah that's just one of the pains on using a free tumblr, if you click through it should be all good 
03:02:37 <TheWhisper> Do you just use tumlbr because it's free?
03:02:54 <TheWhisper> If so, let me introduce you to
03:02:58 <TheWhisper> ?portfolio
03:03:14 <TheWhisper> ^ all of those are awesome free/cheap places to make a portfolio
03:03:51 <adding_confusion> i liked the idea of tumblr because I could post to it free and if I built myself up in the community there then the posibility of a piece of mine getting shared around increases
03:04:15 <EDSGD> ^same reason I have a tumblr
03:04:34 <EDSGD> I need to whore myself more. 
03:04:37 <TheWhisper> Ah, that makes sense

04:04:31 <zakmac> Looper has a higher RT score
04:04:38 <zakmac> Thoughts?
04:06:04 <TheWhisper> Looper is supposed to be really good, zakmac
04:06:08 <TheWhisper> Are you going to the movies
04:06:10 <TheWhisper> or download?
04:06:14 <zakmac> Going to see
04:06:27 <zakmac> Too early for anything besides a TS and I demand at least R5 quality
04:06:38 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I was gonna say that I didn't think it was out online
04:06:43 <TheWhisper> I don't even count TS/CAM
04:06:47 <TheWhisper> They're unwatchable
04:06:50 <zakmac> Exactly
04:07:06 <zakmac> R5 is at LEAST a VHS rip which is even fine
04:07:20 <zakmac> Usually screener DVD though
04:07:21 <TheWhisper> Is there a way to tell if a bottle is a twist or a pop
04:07:33 <zakmac> The metal caps?
04:07:39 <TheWhisper> yeah
04:07:43 <zakmac> Not unless you see threading below it
04:07:48 <TheWhisper> it's a woodchuck hard cider
04:07:59 <zakmac> Generally the indents on the side don't all go 100% in on twist off though
04:08:31 <TheWhisper> hm
04:08:33 <zakmac> "In this segment of Cider Maker's Corner, John answers fans who have been asking why Woodchuck switched from a twist-off to a pry-off cap."

04:09:48 <TheWhisper> Damn
04:09:55 <TheWhisper> We somehow don't have a bottle opener
04:10:02 <zakmac> I'm just not sure if I want mindless action (EoW) or something more cerebral (Looper)
04:10:03 <TheWhisper> oooh wait my swiss army has one
04:10:06 <TheWhisper> LOOOPER

04:10:55 <TheWhisper> when drunk
04:10:56 <TheWhisper> lol
04:11:07 <zakmac> I always give my finger a horrible pinch and never open the bottle
04:11:08 <TheWhisper> I can also do the hit-with-hand-on-side-of-tabletop thing
04:11:18 <TheWhisper> but that hurts when I'm sober
04:11:33 <TheWhisper> hm

04:36:42 <TheWhisper> they get locked into one state

04:36:54 <TheWhisper> it's both there and not there

18:25:53 <EDSGD> xD
18:28:08 <Carson> i suck at writing papers :/
18:50:20 <medos> not true
18:50:25 <medos> unlesss you actuall finished it
18:54:38 <EDSGD> MODERN FAMILY!
19:17:39 <medos> .gis gloria modern family
19:20:58 <EDSGD> Kat Moss, Kate Moss, Kate Moss
19:30:05 <TheWhisper> Ooooh to be prince caspian
19:30:28 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/nA4Tm.jpg edsgd
19:30:34 <TheWhisper> ^ that's why you should watch doctor who
19:36:58 <EDSGD> That's what Doctor Who is about?
19:37:17 <TheWhisper> Not actuallh
19:37:19 <TheWhisper> *actually
19:37:23 <TheWhisper> but sort of
19:37:28 <TheWhisper> just minus the blaxploitation part
19:38:33 <EDSGD> .u Doctor who episode list
19:38:43 <EDSGD> lol
19:38:54 <EDSGD> .g Doctor who episode list
19:39:35 <TheWhisper> Lol
19:39:57 <TheWhisper> If you actually want to get into it, I would suggest /not/ starting with the older seasons (it started in like 1960 or something)
19:40:32 <TheWhisper> Start with the 2005 reboot
19:41:10 <TheWhisper> The first doctor from that reboot, Chistopher Eccleston, is good but not amazing though
19:41:15 <TheWhisper> So if you really want to get into it
19:41:27 <TheWhisper> I suggest starting with the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant
19:41:48 <EDSGD> EEEHHHH
19:41:55 <EDSGD> I must watch from the start
19:42:09 <TheWhisper> http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Doctor_Who/70142441?trkid=2361637
19:42:15 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I mean, you can obviously do that
19:42:26 <TheWhisper> Just know that the first season of the reboot is good, but not great
19:42:34 <TheWhisper> The next season, with Tennant, is great
19:42:48 <TheWhisper> I think all of Tennant's seasons were great
19:43:49 <TheWhisper> Also, know that the CGI is intentionally a little off
19:43:59 <TheWhisper> The show is intended to be slightly campy
19:44:02 <TheWhisper> While still being very serious
