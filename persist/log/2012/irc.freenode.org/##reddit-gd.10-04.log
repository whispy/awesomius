00:00:19 <TheWhisper> I want a racing bike
00:00:21 <TheWhisper> with spikes
00:00:23 <zm> Except I use the American challenge for comfort sake http://i.imgur.com/umVR3.jpg
00:00:27 <TheWhisper> to kill small animals
00:02:13 <TheWhisper> hm
00:02:18 <TheWhisper> I want a recumbent bike
00:02:25 <TheWhisper> *trike
00:02:27 <TheWhisper> recumbent trike
00:04:20 <TheWhisper> iamlegend what about flat bar road bikes
00:04:44 <TheWhisper> also
00:04:45 <IAmLegend> basically the same as a hybrid
00:04:48 <TheWhisper> a bike that is good in snow
00:04:55 <TheWhisper> http://api.ning.com/files/0rHfQK4OI1CIUxFDOuJenqwN5o0TfX3sjLfqw6NPtzORwDYSHbyChOs2VYjDnyMZumem4F2TiZxZUb5WoDODSwZPvfFBT65z/ktrak.jpg YES
00:05:03 <IAmLegend> yes
00:05:36 <IAmLegend> flat bar road bike is more like a road bike whereas a hybrid can have more mountain mike components
00:06:04 <TheWhisper> Which would be better for snow?
00:06:22 <TheWhisper> snow/ice
00:06:37 <IAmLegend> neither
00:06:44 <IAmLegend> lol
00:06:48 <IAmLegend> get ^^^^
00:07:04 <TheWhisper> ?
00:07:06 <TheWhisper> oh
00:12:12 <TheWhisper> http://www.terrengsykkel.no/img/guide/tester/full/0811192537_Surly-Pugsley%20%286%29.jpg look at those tires
00:15:48 <IAmLegend> tyres probably cost $100
00:15:50 <IAmLegend> lol
00:15:53 <TheWhisper> Surly Pugsley
00:15:55 <TheWhisper> looks sick
00:27:32 <TheWhisper> iamlegend: http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3314549162.html
00:28:08 <TheWhisper> ?
00:28:55 <IAmLegend> yeah that doesn't look too bad
00:29:05 <IAmLegend> main thing with a bike is that it fits your properly
00:29:09 <IAmLegend> how tall are you?
00:29:15 <TheWhisper> uh
00:29:25 <TheWhisper> 6'11"
00:29:29 <TheWhisper> 6 feet 11 inches
00:29:30 <TheWhisper> wiat
00:29:31 <TheWhisper> wait
00:29:32 <TheWhisper> 5
00:29:36 <TheWhisper> 5 feet 11 inches lol
00:29:38 <IAmLegend> lol
00:29:41 <IAmLegend> ok
00:30:06 <IAmLegend> that bike looks like its for a fairly short person
00:30:12 <TheWhisper> there is this place: http://mellovelobicycles.com/bikes/
00:30:15 <TheWhisper> literally around the corner from me
00:30:28 <IAmLegend> they won't have a new bike for $100
00:30:36 <TheWhisper> They do used too
00:30:38 <IAmLegend> oh i see
00:30:40 <IAmLegend> yep
00:30:51 <IAmLegend> used bikes aren't that cheap, but check them out first
00:30:58 <IAmLegend> because they'll at least fit you to a bike

00:31:24 <AmandaS4ys> 'allo

00:31:56 <AmandaS4ys> hiya :) how goes it?
00:32:04 <IAmLegend> what font?

00:32:15 <AmandaS4ys> sorry find isnt the right word
00:32:19 <AmandaS4ys> more like, identify it
00:32:23 <TheWhisper> Oh lol
00:32:24 <TheWhisper> yeah
00:32:25 <TheWhisper> didn't see that
00:32:25 <AmandaS4ys> yup
00:32:29 <AmandaS4ys> http://www.fairtradeusa.org/fair-trade-month
00:32:38 <AmandaS4ys> where it says "every purchase matters"
00:32:44 <AmandaS4ys> i KNOW ive seen that font but idk where
00:32:57 <IAmLegend> yeah, i don't know
00:33:10 <IAmLegend> could be any hand drawn font on even somewhere like dafont
00:33:12 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3291863415.html iamlegend, this seems good. 75 bucks, modded a bit (for the city in which I'll be riding it too!)
00:33:35 <AmandaS4ys> right? 
00:33:46 <AmandaS4ys> ooo nice bike TheWhisper 
00:33:54 <TheWhisper> Do you know about bikes?
00:34:06 <AmandaS4ys> no, but it looks nice
00:34:08 <IAmLegend> TW, those wheels would be purely road wheels
00:34:11 <AmandaS4ys> sorry T.T
00:34:11 <AmandaS4ys> lol
00:34:21 <IAmLegend> you wouldn't even go on too many dirt tracks with it
00:34:25 <TheWhisper> Oh :(
00:34:27 <TheWhisper> And amanda, not insulting
00:34:29 <TheWhisper> legit asking lol
00:34:32 <TheWhisper> I'm trying to find a bike
00:34:32 <IAmLegend> but you'd be able to change the tyres if you want
00:34:34 <TheWhisper> and I don't know much
00:34:50 <TheWhisper> hm
00:34:54 <IAmLegend> but tyres are at least $40 each and then you'll need tubes $10 each
00:34:59 <IAmLegend> minimum
00:35:17 <IAmLegend> never heard of that brand wither
00:35:21 <IAmLegend> either*
00:35:25 <AmandaS4ys> hmm
00:35:29 <TheWhisper> weird that I can't find this model
00:35:32 <TheWhisper> on the magna site
00:35:34 <AmandaS4ys> ive just heard that good bikes go for like $100
00:35:37 <IAmLegend> and 7 speeds arent much
00:35:41 <AmandaS4ys> but i dont know why they would be that expensive
00:36:15 <TheWhisper> amanda, because they're bikes
00:36:16 <TheWhisper> lol
00:36:24 <AmandaS4ys> idk, i dont even know how to RIDE one
00:36:25 <AmandaS4ys> lol
00:36:38 <TheWhisper> iamlegend: http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3285167066.html
00:36:49 <IAmLegend> girls bike
00:37:23 <TheWhisper> Does that matter in terms of anything besides "ew it's a girls bike and i'm a dude"?
00:37:31 <TheWhisper> like are they weighted differently and shit?
00:38:02 <IAmLegend> girls bikes will be shorter
00:38:19 <TheWhisper> ok
00:38:20 <IAmLegend> and you can tell because the top bar runs further down 
00:38:35 <TheWhisper> And do you think that 7 speeds is too few?
00:38:49 <IAmLegend> it'd be easier to maintain
00:39:01 <IAmLegend> but it's not much, especially if you want to go in the snow
00:39:18 <TheWhisper> I haven't ridden a bike in like
00:39:21 <TheWhisper> wow
00:39:27 <TheWhisper> Since I got my driver's license haha
00:39:35 <TheWhisper> So like 6 years
00:40:44 <IAmLegend> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3304968782.html
00:40:48 <IAmLegend> thats not bad
00:41:18 <IAmLegend> schwinn are a pretty good brand, has fairly meaty tyres but would be reasonably heavy
00:41:25 <IAmLegend> most mountain bikes are though
00:41:31 <TheWhisper> "There is one sprocket on the freewheel that has broken off so, when using that gear if you pedal too hard it will skip" what does that mean
00:41:49 <AmandaS4ys> sounds... bad... lol
00:42:08 <IAmLegend> oh you might need a new cog
00:42:16 <IAmLegend> not sure how much that would be
00:42:27 <TheWhisper> hm
00:43:01 <IAmLegend> depends on how rare the parts are
00:43:05 <IAmLegend> could be like $50
00:43:17 <TheWhisper> Does that mean
00:43:18 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/saq3b.png
00:43:23 <TheWhisper> that one of those little spikes broke?
00:43:26 <IAmLegend> yep
00:43:44 <TheWhisper> ok
00:43:53 <IAmLegend> id imagine with any sub $100 bike you'd have to take it to a bike shop to get it serviced anywya
00:43:56 <TheWhisper> yeah
00:44:01 <IAmLegend> service is around $30 usually
00:44:05 <TheWhisper> only 30 minutes away from me
00:44:09 <IAmLegend> ok
00:44:33 <IAmLegend> if you haven't rode a bike for a while, the wider tyres will get you more confidence
00:45:18 <TheWhisper> Why do you know so much about bikes?
00:45:36 <IAmLegend> i don't know a heap about them, but i ride every weekend nearly
00:46:13 <TheWhisper> for pleasure or what?
00:46:16 <IAmLegend> yeah
00:46:24 <TheWhisper> cool
00:46:44 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3303791846.html
00:46:46 <TheWhisper> FLAMES
00:46:46 <TheWhisper> lol
00:46:54 <IAmLegend> lol
00:46:54 <AmandaS4ys> lol
00:47:03 <IAmLegend> http://www.productwiki.com/upload/images/giant_defy_3.jpg
00:47:06 <IAmLegend> thats what i have
00:47:16 <TheWhisper> Hm
00:47:21 <TheWhisper> That's definitely a bike.
00:47:54 <IAmLegend> and one similar to this
00:47:55 <IAmLegend> http://www.mbkbike.com/catalog/p_87779.jpg
00:48:01 <IAmLegend> but not front suspension
00:49:07 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3300870241.html
00:50:42 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3291161371.html < lol
00:51:02 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3289677250.html "
00:51:02 <TheWhisper> Will include the attached computer" what
00:51:43 <IAmLegend> last one is a womens bike too
00:51:58 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3288985475.html <- definitely a mugging
00:52:10 <TheWhisper> the two bikes in the pics aren't even the same looking
00:52:42 <TheWhisper> whoa
00:52:48 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3274288605.html iamlegend this one looks nice
00:52:49 <IAmLegend> he's got two
00:52:57 <IAmLegend> those are so heavy
00:53:13 <TheWhisper> Which? The one I just linked?
00:53:16 <IAmLegend> yep
00:53:20 <IAmLegend> the 'nice' one
00:53:23 <IAmLegend> they weigh a ton
00:53:34 <TheWhisper> hm
00:53:38 <TheWhisper> How much is a ton?
00:53:47 <IAmLegend> for a bike, they're heavy
00:53:55 <TheWhisper> 30 pounds?
00:53:57 <TheWhisper> 10?
00:53:57 <TheWhisper> 40?
00:54:02 <IAmLegend> i do kg
00:54:02 <TheWhisper> kilos is fine too
00:54:03 <IAmLegend> lol
00:54:13 <TheWhisper> "kilos is fine too"
00:54:52 <IAmLegend> i don't know the weight
00:54:59 <IAmLegend> but they are heavy to lift and heavy to ride
00:55:17 <TheWhisper> I can't even tell the exact model from the pic
00:55:29 <IAmLegend> the last one?
00:55:32 <TheWhisper> yeah
00:55:33 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3217107326.html
00:55:35 <TheWhisper> ?
00:55:43 <IAmLegend> that'd be worse
00:55:47 <IAmLegend> Huffy make terrible bikes
00:55:50 <TheWhisper> Okay
00:55:52 <TheWhisper> Out of all the options
00:56:00 <TheWhisper> you think the one you linked is the best?
00:56:08 <IAmLegend> id get the one with the sprocket damaged
00:56:14 <TheWhisper> okay
00:56:23 <IAmLegend> do you have that link?
00:56:32 <TheWhisper> http://syracuse.craigslist.org/bik/3304968782.html
00:57:09 <TheWhisper> How is height measured to pair with a bike?
00:57:11 <IAmLegend> it looks in good condition
00:57:20 <TheWhisper> Like what do they measure in the bike
00:57:23 <IAmLegend> some measure the top tube and some the inner tube
00:57:26 <IAmLegend> its very confusing
00:57:49 <TheWhisper> hm
00:57:59 <IAmLegend> 26 inch is the wheels which is standard
00:58:10 <IAmLegend> but that doesn't mean its big or small
00:58:22 <IAmLegend> bah
00:58:29 <IAmLegend> if they've paid $170 at target
00:58:30 <IAmLegend> its crap
00:58:32 <IAmLegend> tbh
00:58:35 <TheWhisper> lol
00:58:57 <IAmLegend> you'd be paying at least $125
00:59:27 <TheWhisper> Yeah
00:59:31 <IAmLegend> maybe get one from somewhere like target?
00:59:33 <IAmLegend> brand new?
00:59:36 <TheWhisper> It  doesn't need to be a super high quality bike though
00:59:52 <TheWhisper> If I end up riding a good amount more
00:59:57 <TheWhisper> I can upgrade at some point
01:00:00 <IAmLegend> yeah, then get a better one
01:00:01 <TheWhisper> to the iBike 5
01:00:10 <IAmLegend> bikes don't devalue that quickly
01:00:16 <IAmLegend> lol
01:00:44 <TheWhisper> yeah
01:00:50 <IAmLegend> try here
01:00:50 <IAmLegend> http://mellovelobicycles.com/bikes/
01:00:56 <TheWhisper> Wow, target's site sucks
01:00:56 <IAmLegend> see what they say
01:01:07 <IAmLegend> at least then you'll be able to be fit correctly
01:01:10 <TheWhisper> Yeah
01:01:20 <TheWhisper> Only thing is I feel like they may be $$$
01:01:22 <TheWhisper> cuz they're hipsters
01:01:25 <IAmLegend> yeah
01:01:29 <TheWhisper> and they run a cafe in the same building
01:01:35 <TheWhisper> seems like a recipe for expensiveness
01:01:43 <IAmLegend> second hand bike stores that sell new bikes also want you in a new bike instead
01:01:45 <TheWhisper> Good food though
01:02:30 <TheWhisper> What bicycle frame would I want, do you think?
01:02:31 <TheWhisper> 18?
01:02:55 <IAmLegend> yeah probably
01:03:11 <TheWhisper> what do you use
01:03:14 <TheWhisper>  and how tall are you?
01:03:46 <IAmLegend> im 6ft 1
01:03:52 <IAmLegend> giant measure a bit different
01:04:49 <IAmLegend> http://www.evanscycles.com/help/bike-sizing#hybrid
01:04:51 <IAmLegend> thats a good guide
01:04:57 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/MdOpr.png
01:05:32 <TheWhisper> those are the target ones 
01:05:32 <TheWhisper> with 18 inch frames
01:05:32 <TheWhisper> between 0 and 170 bucks
01:05:32 <IAmLegend> ok well no to both huffys
01:05:42 <TheWhisper> oh, also those are the mountain bikes too
01:05:44 <IAmLegend> i haven't heard of magna so i can't really say
01:05:50 <TheWhisper> should I be looking in other categories of bike?
01:06:19 <IAmLegend> mountain bikes will give you suspension generally either in the front forks (like 1,2 and 4)
01:06:27 <IAmLegend> in the seat post (can't tell)
01:06:32 <IAmLegend> or in the frame like 1 and 2
01:06:50 <TheWhisper> Hm
01:07:03 <IAmLegend> but you're probably better off with one of any of these than a second hand one
01:07:06 <TheWhisper> just expanded the search to the same settings, but all bikes:
01:07:14 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/a6BdS.png
01:07:26 <TheWhisper> Didn't really add anything good
01:07:34 <IAmLegend> cruisers like 1 and 2 are rediculous
01:07:43 <IAmLegend> and the bottom left two
01:07:54 <IAmLegend> yeah, they're more like lane way things

01:16:03 <TheWhisper> Okay, let's watch the debates for 5 minutes

01:22:18 <TheWhisper> also, everything romney says is an anectdote
01:22:27 <TheWhisper> *anecdote
01:23:53 <TheWhisper> "I think math, common sense, and our history, shows that's not an approach for growth"
01:23:56 <TheWhisper> Nice line, brobama
01:24:33 <zakmac> Debates are a crock, nothing important is ever discussed in depth
01:25:00 <TheWhisper> True
01:25:25 <TheWhisper> Though, I'm sort of surprised by how much they're actually saying
01:25:42 <TheWhisper> Usually they say a lot more but actually communicate much less
01:25:49 <zakmac> But how much are they /actually/ *saying*
01:25:54 <zakmac> Ah

01:29:41 <TheWhisper> Yeah
01:29:50 <zakmac> Shit, I'd miss AR
01:29:58 <TheWhisper> Obama's speaking is pretty stilted
01:30:04 <TheWhisper> Romney's been much smoother so far
01:30:19 <TheWhisper> Seems the first term got to Obama :P
01:30:32 <zakmac> Everyone always says he's so well spoken and I've never seen speech by him that impressed me
01:31:00 <TheWhisper> Yeah
01:31:27 <zakmac> As Obama's six minutes over his 2min limit
01:31:28 <TheWhisper> fuck it

01:40:51 <TheWhisper> hey carson, are you interested in politics?
01:41:08 <TheWhisper> LOL
01:41:31 <TheWhisper> "the reason she could be independent was because of social security and medicare"
01:41:44 <TheWhisper> so independent = getting money from other people :)
01:41:55 <zakmac> Socialist
01:41:57 <TheWhisper> Not criticizing those systems, but just obama's word fumbling
01:42:18 <zakmac> He is speaking the truth right now
01:42:24 <TheWhisper> yup
01:42:30 <zakmac> The fraud measures they put in place are saving tons
01:43:21 <TheWhisper> "oh i just thought about one"
01:43:22 <TheWhisper> wow
01:43:26 <TheWhisper> that's so fucking fake and rehearsed
01:43:39 <zakmac> Forgot that $716B
01:43:44 <TheWhisper> yup
01:43:52 <zakmac> Woops
01:44:14 <TheWhisper> I don't get it
01:45:48 <TheWhisper> "Consider what the Romney campaign, then, is saying: If Romney is elected, then by his third year in office, every single federal program that is not Medicare, Social Security, or defense, will be cut, on average, by 40 percent. That means Medicaid, infrastructure, education, food safety, road safety, the postal service, basic research, foreign aid, housing subsidies, food stamps, the Census, Pell grants, the Patent and Trademark Office
01:45:48 <TheWhisper> , the FDA  all of it has to be cut by, on average, 40 percent. If Romney tried to protect any particular priority, it would mean all the others have to be cut by more than 40 percent."
01:45:54 <TheWhisper> so to not cut from medicare
01:45:57 <TheWhisper> he'd fuck everything else
01:47:52 <zakmac> Old people vote, they don't have anything better to do after their 5a breakfast at Denny's

04:16:16 <R0tt3n> so.. how does this relate to me? I should just keep doing work even though i think it looks shitty until i get to a point where i like the stuff im putting out?
04:16:24 <R0tt3n> cause thats kinda what i got out of it
04:17:05 <medos> no idea, i thought you'd like a cool video
04:17:55 <TheWhisper> "From the FBI's perspective, clicking on the illicit hyperlink and having a thumbs.db file with illicit images are both serious crimes."
04:17:57 <TheWhisper> seriously
04:18:11 <TheWhisper> also, r0tt3n
04:18:14 <TheWhisper> it's essentially saying
04:18:16 <TheWhisper> do work
04:18:24 <TheWhisper> until it's good work
04:18:28 <TheWhisper> and then keep doing it
04:18:31 <TheWhisper> until you're as good as me ;)
04:18:38 <TheWhisper> at that point, you'll suck
04:18:46 <TheWhisper> and that's when the fun starts
04:19:22 <R0tt3n> lol, yeah i have a good poster that someone made that conveys the same thing
04:19:27 <R0tt3n> let me upload it
04:19:29 <R0tt3n> one sec
04:19:44 <TheWhisper> I bet it's the Ira Glass one
04:19:46 <TheWhisper> I BET IT IS
04:20:02 <TheWhisper> I wish I had 3 months off
04:20:11 <TheWhisper> to focus on nothing but my craft

04:20:16 <TheWhisper> He was a lucky dude
04:20:24 <TheWhisper> YES
04:20:26 <TheWhisper> IRA GLASS
04:20:52 <R0tt3n> but im like at that point right now i feel, where im dissatisfied with my work, like it can be so much better i just cant seem to get it there
04:21:15 <TheWhisper> r0tt3n http://vimeo.com/24715531

04:36:27 <R0tt3n> would it be bad to ask a client to send me some examples of the style he/she wants in a logo?
04:37:07 <marshmallow> tell them to send you a brief =D
04:37:24 <R0tt3n> is that what its called?

04:39:21 <medos> (06:39:07) (@TheWhisper): more like I was fucking confused because my brain is dumb
04:39:27 <TheWhisper> yes
04:40:25 <medos> nvm
04:41:08 <TheWhisper> lol
04:43:37 <TheWhisper> The right answer would be that I /slightly/ prefer thin people to fat people
04:45:06 <TheWhisper> medos: "For example, if asked "Do you like Turks?" many Germans will respond "yes" because they regard themselves as unprejudiced. However, an IAT may reveal that these same Germans have automatic negative associations toward Turks. (This IAT result has been demonstrated quite clearly in Germany."
04:45:15 <TheWhisper> Do you like Turks?
04:45:42 <marshmallow> yes!
04:47:35 <medos> i'm indifferent to turks, i'm interested in seeing if this new catalyst driver fixes my illustrator problems
04:48:02 <medos> how can i dislike or like an entire ethnic group?
04:48:17 <medos> racist question
04:48:20 <medos> obviously

04:51:40 <TheWhisper> lol
04:51:42 <TheWhisper> medos
04:52:04 <TheWhisper> I'm going to take that answer as you saying "yes, i have unconscious negative associations toward turks"
04:52:08 <TheWhisper> also, science ain't racist
04:52:30 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/bEalo.png
04:52:33 <TheWhisper> well that's right
04:52:34 <TheWhisper> hm

06:27:55 <medos> IAmLegend correction: 1. game works if i turn of wifi, make sure nothing is in the notification center, turn off and on again
06:28:08 <medos> then i get to the point of seeing your rgb buttons
06:28:13 <medos> then it kicks me out
06:28:22 <IAmLegend> ok so you select the level
06:28:28 <IAmLegend> and the game starts but then closes
06:28:34 <medos> yup
06:28:38 <IAmLegend> ok thanks
06:28:43 <medos> i saw the pink brain telling me to do something
06:28:53 <medos> while his command went out of the speech bubble
06:29:55 <IAmLegend> try level 4 if you don't mind
06:30:02 <IAmLegend> or can't you select the level?
06:30:28 <medos> it behaves like your photoshop
06:30:32 <medos> one it's out of memory
06:30:49 <medos> it just bugs out until you reboot
06:30:56 <medos> not going to reboot this thing all the mtime now
06:31:03 <IAmLegend> ok
06:31:05 <IAmLegend> thats ok
06:31:07 <IAmLegend> thanks
06:31:34 <IAmLegend> bah i won't pass that part on
06:31:42 <IAmLegend> either works or it doesn't ;)
06:33:19 <IAmLegend> does bridge allow me to rename images like X-001 X-002 etc
06:34:55 <TheWhisper> in batch?
06:35:01 <TheWhisper> Irfanview does :)
06:35:10 <IAmLegend> yeah in batch
06:35:12 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/ANQU9.png
06:35:25 <TheWhisper> it also allows you to do: http://i.imgur.com/XF0Pa.png
06:35:36 <IAmLegend> wow
06:35:42 <IAmLegend> don't need all of that, but nice
06:35:44 <medos> same goes for bridge
06:35:48 <IAmLegend> ok
06:35:52 <IAmLegend> so bridge does it
06:36:34 <medos> tools -> batch or something
06:36:38 <IAmLegend> yep thats ok
06:36:43 <IAmLegend> just wanted to make sure it does it
06:36:54 <IAmLegend> ill do it tomorrow
06:38:52 <medos> everything photoshop or illustrator can do
06:38:57 <medos> bridge can do batch
06:39:03 <medos> batchoo
06:39:13 <TheWhisper> photoshop can also do batch
06:39:16 <TheWhisper> using actions
06:39:18 <TheWhisper> and 
06:39:20 <TheWhisper> automate
06:39:23 <IAmLegend> yeah
06:39:27 <IAmLegend> i don't like that much though
06:40:22 <IAmLegend> i have to have them on bridge (or similar) anyway to present to the client
06:40:26 <medos> that's what i meant with batch-features
06:40:29 <IAmLegend> want to star them and tag them etc
06:40:35 <medos> renaming is built-in though :)
06:40:53 <IAmLegend> cool

15:16:24 * marshmallow wuvs my samsung galaxy s2

15:17:04 <marshmallow> but why get the s2?

15:19:01 <medos> built quality and components are more important
15:19:07 <medos> *build
15:19:10 <marshmallow> I have an ASUS A53SV-EH71.  Same specs or better as a Macbook Pro 15inch.  (RAM, Memory, Processor, etc.) The big difference was $1200 less than a shiny mac.
15:19:35 * medos would never buy an asus laptop
15:19:45 <medos> except for eee netbooks those are neat
15:19:52 <marshmallow> it's alright.  No real issues for the past year-ish
15:20:04 <marshmallow> I've also used dell for years
15:22:15 <medos> i'll need to buy a new laptop before christmas
15:22:27 <medos> this one is five months old
15:23:38 <adding_confusion> i have always thought asus was one of the best / better brands
15:23:51 <marshmallow> better then HP
15:23:53 <marshmallow> =p
15:24:00 <adding_confusion> i helped my girlfriend's mom get a comp and we got her an asus
15:24:32 <marshmallow> yea, my computer techy friends said asus is a good brand
15:24:53 <adding_confusion> i dont know why but IM mostly worried about any computer other than mac heating up too much when its on my lap or on the covers of my bed
15:24:56 <marshmallow> it was between asus & HP for me..  and my sister was having a nightmare with her HP so I said screw that.  Asus.  =p
15:25:32 <medos> http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2362039,00.asp :)
15:25:48 <adding_confusion> id love to be able to get 2x specs for the price so i am rally looking hard at some windows machines
15:26:21 <marshmallow> meh.  my sister had to get her HP repaired a few times.  She's a gamer.  
15:27:27 <medos> probably has a gaming laptop :)
15:27:48 <marshmallow> yar, it is
15:27:55 <medos> those suck a lot when used excessively
15:28:29 <marshmallow> I assume gaming laptops have the best specs (video card / memory)
15:28:54 <medos> yup, doesn't mean they work well when you keep them running and use them for 8-12 hours a day
15:30:02 <marshmallow> my dell is on for 8-12hrs a day.  works fine,
15:30:18 <marshmallow> I've had dells for.. 10+ years
15:30:39 <marshmallow> they're durable.  I just don't like how clunky/heavy they are.  haha
15:32:05 <adding_confusion> i was looking at the alienware g14 i know there is a stigma against alienware on the internets
15:32:10 <medos> D:
15:32:57 <marshmallow> aren't those the most expensive gaming computers?
15:33:28 <medos> friend of mine has one, impressive piece of machinery, but far too silly with rainbow color backlit keyboard and funky features that might or might not work
15:34:56 <adding_confusion> yeah maybe too crazy.. i need to put the laptop in the "will i get laughed out of the coffee shop if i were to have my laptop out?" test
15:36:11 <medos> .y alienware g14 laptop review
15:36:32 <medos> .tell Awesomius rude.
15:36:53 <adding_confusion> maybe m14 ?
15:37:00 <medos> .y alienware m14 laptop review
15:37:27 <medos> haha
15:37:44 <medos> yeah, pretty much the same thing i've seen
15:38:00 <adding_confusion> its like a tron laptop
15:38:19 <medos> if i remember correctly those alienware laptops have two batterys
15:38:31 <medos> *batteries
15:38:50 <medos> what's the difference between a nvidia quadro and nvidia geforce?
15:39:57 <medos> same goes for amd/ati radeon and amd/ati fireGL
15:40:12 <medos> if you're not considering the components you might get problems in the long run
15:47:15 <medos> http://www.nvidia.com/object/adobe-cs6.html
15:47:45 <medos> quadro/firegl = almost the same but built for business, less frequent funky driver updates and more stability
15:48:33 <medos> adobe, autodesk and other companies always try to make their windows tools work best with business-grade hardware
15:50:33 <medos> alienware = gets released, gets benchmarked, gets forgotten, no one knows how well that thing will work after a year
15:50:46 <medos> /rant
15:52:18 <marshmallow> ah ha!  i found the website
15:52:20 <marshmallow> http://www.cpubenchmark.net/
15:52:30 <marshmallow> use it to compare all the important specs =D
15:53:08 <medos> impossibru
15:54:35 <marshmallow> I used it to pick my asus.  that's why I know it's just as good as a macbook pro. =p
15:54:58 <marshmallow> (actually, better in certain areas too.  tee hee!)
15:55:46 <medos> my entire rant just now was about not picking a laptop solely by fastest specs :p
15:56:03 * marshmallow has had no problems so far yet with good specs
15:56:08 <marshmallow> =p
15:57:39 * medos sits at home freelancing, had plenty of problems with his latest laptop and as such was actually unable to work for quite a few times due to driver/performance issues
15:59:30 <medos> .gis thinkpad t61
16:00:44 <marshmallow> I kinda think you should be using a desktop
16:00:47 <marshmallow> instead of a laptop
16:00:53 <marshmallow> for that extended usage =p

16:08:21 <medos> adding_confusion what's your current work machine/laptop?
16:11:34 <adding_confusion> im on a 2009-2010 macbook pro 15"
16:11:43 <adding_confusion> it belongs to my work though and I need to stop using it for freelance
16:13:26 <medos> if you're open to suggestions i would recommend looking at hp probooks and lenovo thinkpads
16:14:06 <marshmallow> I recommend waiting 2 more months
16:14:11 <marshmallow> cyber monday deals! =p
16:14:33 <marshmallow> or black friday deals
16:14:48 <marshmallow> that's what I'm waiting for.  I want another external hardrive for my gazillion photos
16:15:31 <adding_confusion> oh good idea
16:15:45 <adding_confusion> i will look into both of those thanks @medos
16:17:46 <medos> they might not look as impressive on the hardware specs side and seem weirdly expensive for no reason whatsoever, they're built for heavy use though and tend to survive a loooot longer
16:19:11 <marshmallow> ewww.  why would I buy a PC to install Mac OS
16:19:24 <marshmallow> win7 =D
16:22:34 <medos> :D
16:22:51 <medos> thanks for reminding me that i have to install w8
16:23:36 <adding_confusion> is win8 out?
16:24:21 <medos> no it's in
16:24:25 <medos> trendy as hell
16:26:38 <marshmallow> lol
16:26:54 <marshmallow> i'll upgrade to win8.. er... when i buy a new computer probably
16:26:58 <marshmallow> aka, not anytime soon XD

18:14:44 <EDSGD> whats up
18:14:53 <TheWhisper> <medos> yup, doesn't mean they work well when you keep them running and use them for 8-12 hours a day <- Mine's worked pretty well for the past two years, and it's not even a gaming laptop.
18:15:00 <marshmallow> nada.  go back to lurking =p
18:16:25 <medos> you don't design stuff though
18:16:27 <medos> ?whisper
18:16:44 <TheWhisper> I thought we were talking about gaming
18:16:59 <TheWhisper> Isn't this ##reddit-GameDiscussion?
18:17:08 <TheWhisper> Shit, I've been in the wrong channel this entire time!
18:17:18 <medos> i thought we were talking about laptop-purchase for a designer who wants to start freelancing
18:17:48 <TheWhisper> I wasn't really paying attention to the discussion. I just scrolled through, so I probs missed the purpose
18:17:54 <TheWhisper> I just saw people talking about gaming laptops

18:23:04 <TheWhisper> I'm eating carrots right now, so I cannot, in good faith, answer your question.
18:23:07 <medos> by the way: does anyone here know a good tool for batch watermarking? commandline would be best

18:23:17 <TheWhisper> Caaaaarrrots are such a steal
18:23:18 <medos> Carrots improve eyesight.
18:23:22 <TheWhisper> Caaaarrroots have such appeal.

18:25:34 <marshmallow> woops.  not free or no install
18:25:36 <marshmallow> sorryz
18:25:36 <medos> it's about handing it to someone who has no clue about design
18:25:36 <TheWhisper> Why not use Irfan then?
18:25:44 <TheWhisper> Hm
18:25:45 <medos> and making it as easy as possible for him

20:37:54 <TheWhisper> Where do you work at again?
20:37:59 <marshmallow> somewhere in nyc

20:38:51 <medos> my coworkers had 40
20:38:58 <medos> aand no idea how to use layers in indesign

20:40:03 <TheWhisper> Don't mention it again
20:40:11 <TheWhisper> or else your coworkers will appear like beetljuice
20:40:21 <TheWhisper> also that's the first time we've said beetlejuice in here
20:40:29 <TheWhisper> Shit, that's the second!
20:40:32 <marshmallow> well, these coworkers know indesign.  at least their resumes says they do
20:40:48 <marshmallow> =p
20:41:33 <marshmallow> and they know wordpress!  woot =p
20:41:38 <medos> my coworkers and i were sitting in an office that had "Technical Dept." on its door
20:41:53 <medos> from the old days where shit was letterpressed
20:41:57 <medos> |:
20:43:47 <TheWhisper> Images of people letterpressing feces just ran through my mind.
20:44:01 <TheWhisper> I'm surprised some hipster nouveau-modernist has not done that as performance art.
20:45:41 <TheWhisper> Whoa

22:02:15 <medos> hey nicky :)
22:02:42 <nickyjames> helloooooooooooo. 
22:03:44 <nickyjames> I have a question. I need someone to make me a quick sign. It's for my boss. I want to impress him. It's relatively simple and I have the logo. shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. And I don't think /r/design is the right place to post it. Can someone help me out or point me to a good sub for this kind of thing?
22:04:12 <nickyjames> my boss wants me to make a very simple and professional sign that simply says "Courtesy of Golden West" in a nice, but easily readable font. It's to go on carts with drinks that are being offered for free from us for passengers on the new airline.
22:04:32 <medos> http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=193126491&locale=en_US&trk=prof-0-ovw-view-secondary ?
22:04:35 <medos> oooops
22:04:38 <medos> ignore that
22:04:42 <medos> http://www.online-sign.com/
22:05:08 <nickyjames> with the logo that I have. But I wanted to impress him by not going to a simple word doc with centered black ya know? lol
22:05:11 <nickyjames> clicking link
22:06:07 <medos> cmyk or rgb? A4 or letter sized? poster size? how many colors where is it going to get printed? coated paper? pdf/eps/ps/ai/psd format?
22:06:13 <medos> define simple and professional
22:06:16 <medos> mood ?
22:06:17 <medos> colors?
22:06:19 <medos> setting?
22:06:38 <medos> if it's an airline are the logos available in vector?
22:06:47 <medos> would i be giving away the rights to the design?
22:08:38 <medos> where's the logo file?
22:09:15 <nickyjames> cmyk. letter sized. just a piece o paper that we're laminating and sticking to drink carts. not very high end at all. I just wanted something a little better than a word doc. light mood business casual. The only thing I was provided logo wise was http://imgur.com/a/JUbjG. You'd be giving away the right, if there are any rights to give. not a lot of people would see it tbh. 30 passengers max. it's a pretty small scale thing.
22:10:47 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/YJdlE.png
22:10:54 <medos> that's not at all anywhere close to being print ready
22:11:48 <medos> logo should be available in cmyk and vector outlines (.ai .eps or .pdf extensions)
22:11:56 <medos> we're at
22:12:00 <medos> 8 minutes
22:13:00 <nickyjames> brb boss is calling. if this is something you dont want to do don't be pressured. be right back though!
22:13:02 <medos> i'm also not gillbates
22:13:05 <medos> ok
22:13:14 <medos> you said quality
22:13:25 <medos> not looking like a cheap word doc
22:13:43 <medos> would need proper logo file for that
22:15:06 <medos> http://www.google.com/webfonts#ChoosePlace:select
22:15:28 <medos> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors
22:15:43 <medos> + vector outlines of the logo
22:15:46 <nickyjames> looks like I haven't been fitted with the right things to do this with then.
22:16:26 <medos> ask around
22:16:32 <medos> someone must have the design assets
