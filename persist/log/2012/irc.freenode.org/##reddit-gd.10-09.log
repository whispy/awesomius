00:02:50 <TheWhisper> lolol
00:03:11 <Kocho> I don't like that one TheWhisper.
00:03:19 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I was joking :P
00:04:57 <Kocho> I wasn't.
00:05:20 <TheWhisper> I know :P
00:06:13 <medos> http://www.mspaintadventures.com/sweetbroandhellajeff/archive/001.jpg
00:06:50 <Kocho> Poor Jeff
00:10:53 <TheWhisper> You made him leave
00:11:00 <Kocho> No I did not.
00:11:12 <TheWhisper> Medos did :p
00:11:41 <TheWhisper> kocho http://i.imgur.com/xra2f.png 
00:11:44 <medos> In the end it was you by making me spend an actual hour on proposing an entirely new layout and look for your site because you were so stuck. :p
00:11:49 <TheWhisper> I think that, despite being thinner and a little closer in tone
00:11:52 <TheWhisper> it offers more contrast
00:11:58 <TheWhisper> so I'm gonna go with that I think
00:12:03 <TheWhisper> Haven't changed text size yet btw
00:12:21 <Kocho> the lines look very similar to befor
00:12:21 <Kocho> e
00:12:24 <TheWhisper> Medos, what?
00:12:28 <TheWhisper> How did that make him leave?
00:12:43 <TheWhisper> Kocho: http://i.imgur.com/L7IwZ.png
00:12:44 <TheWhisper> top = nw
00:12:45 <TheWhisper> now
00:12:47 <TheWhisper> bottom = before
00:13:09 <Kocho> I'll leave it up to you
00:13:26 <TheWhisper> Do you not think it has a better contrast?
00:13:48 <Kocho> It looks better but it doesn't have better contrast.
00:14:07 <TheWhisper> hm
00:14:53 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/JBet9.jpg
00:14:56 <zakmac> Accurate
00:15:59 <medos> TheWhisper it made him leave because i'm being a passive agressive dick to you which i wouldn't be if you would just do some more design in your pastime
00:16:15 <TheWhisper> In my past time?
00:16:24 <TheWhisper> Okay, I'll just put on my time traveling helmet
00:16:26 <TheWhisper> and go to the past
00:16:33 <TheWhisper> where design grows on trees
00:16:41 <medos> .define pastime
00:16:56 <medos> if that's a helmet
00:16:58 <medos> go wear it

00:17:25 <TheWhisper> From me!
00:17:26 <EDSGD> and she already pissed me off
00:17:31 <EDSGD> :(
00:17:40 <Kocho> But was she attractive?
00:17:51 <EDSGD> I specifically state in the e-mail  that I can't do wednesday 
00:17:52 <medos> zakmac http://i.imgur.com/Rffzy.jpg

00:18:01 <EDSGD> and she wants to meet on wednesdays
00:18:02 <EDSGD> wtf
00:18:08 <EDSGD> can't she read!
00:18:13 <EDSGD> *le
00:18:22 <TheWhisper> No, you're supposed to be tutoring her in reading
00:18:22 <TheWhisper> duh
00:18:26 <EDSGD> IDK I haven't met her yet.
00:18:32 <zakmac> Krankenwagen is an awesome name

00:19:00 <EDSGD> I agree with zakmac
00:19:09 <medos> my quake 3 nickname is Krankenstein
00:19:09 <Kocho> 'w' sounds like 'v'
00:19:11 <medos> wheeee
00:19:34 <zakmac> Back in my pre/teen days I was sexecutioner

00:33:03 <Kocho> When I type with my keyboard, I can make words and communicate them with you.
00:34:07 <TheWhisper> It's pretty hard though. All your letters are upside down
00:34:22 <Kocho> Turn your computer upside-down.
00:34:35 <TheWhisper> It is
00:34:43 <TheWhisper> Which is probably why your letters are upside down ;)
00:36:45 <Kocho> If my letters are upside-down then so will yours.
00:37:03 <TheWhisper> That's the joke :P
00:37:45 <Kocho> Upsidedown text is never a joke TheWhisper.
00:37:57 <EDSGD> It is.
00:38:02 <TheWhisper> It kills 30,000 people a month

00:52:01 <zm> Right now at least I'm clicking through to the imgur link and THEN posting
00:52:35 <TheWhisper> lol
00:56:39 <zm> So I've gone ahead and gotten a premium Github account
00:57:17 <zm> Not one benefit beyond private repos
00:57:21 <medos> That's a typical designer thing to do.
00:58:10 <TheWhisper> tipico
00:58:30 <Kocho> Can't beat a good sandwich
00:58:48 <zm> That is such an inaccurate statement

01:05:27 <TheWhisper> Yup
01:06:22 <medos> zm you made me check github and i realized that i forked two thingies forn o reason whatsoever
01:06:32 <medos> where the hell do i remove them again? D:
01:06:34 <zm> What'd you fork?
01:07:25 <zm> Go into the fork and in the navbar click "admin"
01:07:32 <zm> Then scroll to "the danger zone" and delete it
01:07:44 <TheWhisper> When is this developer planning on even coding this site...
01:08:01 <TheWhisper> I've given him the stuff
01:08:27 <medos> done
01:08:29 <medos> thank you
01:08:34 <zm> Your impossibru super fancy scrollbar and everything?
01:08:44 <zm> Probably never
01:09:09 <TheWhisper> and this is all he's done in a week: http://i.imgur.com/GAsMJ.jpg
01:09:42 <medos> he's adapting to your work pace
01:09:51 <TheWhisper> lol
01:10:09 <TheWhisper> And hey, he said it was all doable when I showed it to him :P
01:10:14 <medos> zm i had forks'd www.pea.rs and http://whatthefuckismymashup.com , the latter i edited but never really via git
01:10:20 <medos> the first one just sat there
01:10:43 <medos> how can you complain after whining here for weeks of not getting a psd mockup together?
01:10:45 <medos> :|
01:10:58 <TheWhisper> I'm not complaining
01:11:01 <TheWhisper> Just curious
01:11:08 <TheWhisper> Also, because the event begins on thursday :D
01:11:18 <zm> pea.rs css indentation is maddening
01:11:21 <medos> afaik you failed to meet at least two deadlines
01:11:33 <TheWhisper> Yeah, those were actually not real deadlines
01:11:36 <zm> I'm going to fork it for no other reason than to fix that mess
01:11:36 <TheWhisper> I just thought they were
01:11:44 <medos> lol zm
01:11:59 <medos> if you do well you might get an invite to dribbble
01:12:03 <TheWhisper> But that's because the professor and I weren't really talking. He's hard to reach.
01:12:11 <TheWhisper> Who, me?
01:12:11 <medos> because that's a repo of dribbble founder whoever that is
01:12:13 <TheWhisper> Oh
01:12:14 <TheWhisper> Lol
01:12:15 <TheWhisper> Good
01:12:19 <medos> i'm not talking to you usually
01:12:23 <medos> unless i'm upset
01:12:27 <TheWhisper> usually is key ;)
01:12:31 <medos> yeah
01:12:41 <medos> it's pretty comfy not helping you out
01:12:54 <zm> TheWhisper: IF I cared I would give you a static version in 1/2 hr because its so simple
01:13:09 <zm> I will not though, as I am in the midst of being incredibly lazy as previously noted
01:13:15 <TheWhisper> No worries
01:13:19 <TheWhisper> It's not up to me to get it coded
01:13:25 <TheWhisper> and I think he's a reliable dude
01:13:32 <TheWhisper> So maybe he's just going to pull 2 all nighters or something
01:13:34 <zm> His file naming convention blows
01:13:43 <medos> Cederholm?
01:13:50 <TheWhisper> What?
01:13:51 <zm> My.DATE.file-name fsdof;ajsdlfkdsfa@#!@#%@$$#/index.php.html/css.js

03:06:53 <TheWhisper> oh
03:06:57 <TheWhisper> nevermind
03:06:59 <TheWhisper> lol
03:07:45 <marshmallow> ?_?
03:08:01 <TheWhisper> They mentioned it in a show
03:08:04 <TheWhisper> and I forgot what they were
03:08:06 <TheWhisper> lol
03:10:20 <marshmallow> TheWhisper..   http://www.fastcodesign.com/1670919/pool-a-floating-pool-for-nycs-east-river-plans-a-2015-opening#1 <-- wth?
03:10:31 <TheWhisper> Sounds awesome, right?
03:10:38 <marshmallow> is it heated?
03:11:05 <marshmallow> the Hudson River is freezing
03:11:37 <zakmac> I don't like it
03:11:44 <marshmallow> this got stupid written all over it
03:11:50 <zakmac> Too much novelty, not enough purpose
03:11:58 <marshmallow> tide rises...  WOSSSSSSSShh.
03:13:49 <marshmallow> this has stupid written all over it..
03:14:06 <marshmallow> there's a reason we don't go play in the shorelines of the hudson.
03:15:04 <TheWhisper> Zakmac: purpose is to help clean up the river
03:15:07 <TheWhisper> at least a little bit
03:15:17 <TheWhisper> secondly: marshmallow, do you like the highline?
03:15:26 <TheWhisper> thirdly: it's floating, so it will rise with the tide lol
03:15:48 <zakmac> So I just found out if you run over the google voice text limit it stops letting you type/counting and replaces the count with "Really?"
03:16:17 <TheWhisper> ?
03:16:28 <marshmallow> the highline is a LOT easier to maintain and build
03:16:56 <marshmallow> and, you didn't address the ZOMG IT'S FREEZING COLD issue
03:17:18 <marshmallow> I had a pool.  Anything below 70F.. you never wanted to go in.
03:18:08 <zakmac> Looks at Richie Rich over here with the pool
03:18:32 <marshmallow> lol
03:18:51 <marshmallow> pools are annoying to maintain and clean
03:19:07 <marshmallow> I can't imagine one being in the Hudson will be remotely easy to handle
03:19:22 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/inAGH.png
03:19:37 <zakmac> Plus people are scuzzy and litter
03:19:48 <zakmac> It will be a net loss for the Hudson's ecosystem
03:21:32 <marshmallow> lol
03:21:44 <TheWhisper> Marshmallow, I dunno about the temperature
03:21:51 <marshmallow> so, cold
03:21:52 <TheWhisper> But I'm pretty sure they'll figure it out 
03:22:03 <TheWhisper> Litter, who knwos
03:22:07 <TheWhisper> *knows
03:22:20 <marshmallow> stupid floating pool
03:22:26 <marshmallow> it belongs at a resort
03:22:27 <TheWhisper> Also, marshmallow, the cleaning = the filter things
03:22:30 <TheWhisper> lol
03:22:47 <TheWhisper> I'll talk to you again in 2015 marshmallow
03:22:51 <TheWhisper> oh wait, you won't be here
03:22:56 <TheWhisper> because you'll be swimming in it
03:22:57 <TheWhisper> :P
03:22:58 <marshmallow> eh. just cause you have a filter doesn't mean anything
03:23:10 <marshmallow> we have one.  you still need a lot of manual labor
03:23:22 <marshmallow> and chemicals.  gees, I wonder how they'll do it without chlorine
03:23:42 <marshmallow>  <@TheWhisper> because you'll be swimming in it <-- nah yo.  I got my own pool. =p
03:24:35 <TheWhisper> lol
03:24:42 <TheWhisper> Marshmallow
03:24:45 <TheWhisper> The whole point
03:24:49 <TheWhisper> is they're using special filters
03:26:55 <marshmallow> uh huh...
03:27:03 <marshmallow> can't wait to see those hurricanes destroy em
03:27:19 <marshmallow> or the snow storms
03:27:22 <marshmallow> whichever comes first
03:27:50 <TheWhisper> Lol
03:31:46 <TheWhisper> marshmallow, how was revolution?
03:31:59 <marshmallow> the morality is sooooooooo annoying
03:32:02 <TheWhisper> ?
03:32:14 <TheWhisper> Is the girl a whiny kid again
03:32:25 <marshmallow> yar, she's annoying
03:32:28 <marshmallow> and the boy too
03:32:29 <TheWhisper> ugh
03:32:49 <TheWhisper> So not as good as last week?
03:33:07 <marshmallow> still interesting enough for me to keep watching
03:33:22 <TheWhisper> hm
03:33:25 <marshmallow> i probably should've have read too many spoilers, so it was semi-predictable for me
03:33:30 <marshmallow> *shouldn't have
03:34:30 <marshmallow> I just can't understand in a "kill or be killed" type of world, how could those kiddies have so many morals and still be alive
03:34:53 <TheWhisper> who the fuck is jessica ridgeway
03:35:33 <TheWhisper> Oh, missing girl

04:16:50 <TheWhisper> I remember when he was this dude http://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0LP26W5A0s/0.jpg
04:18:16 <marshmallow> I think some of the first videos I saw were the "how to" videos
04:18:24 <marshmallow> when he was still in hawaii with his friend
04:18:39 <marshmallow> it's been many years of loyal watching XD
04:20:04 <TheWhisper> yeah
04:20:39 <marshmallow> not many youtube stars I've been watching that long...
04:21:09 <marshmallow> him..  angryvideogamenerd, kevjumba, collegehumor, and hishie.
04:21:26 <marshmallow> i've been watching them since...  forever. XD
04:21:39 <marshmallow> other youtubers..  I may/may not watch or lose interest in
04:24:22 <marshmallow> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNMQHiHwSNM <-- I think this is the first one I saw from nigahiga
04:28:24 <TheWhisper> nice
04:31:36 <marshmallow> yar, I loved HEROES.  I was shocked to see he got to interview Milo
04:31:55 <marshmallow> though, looking back on it... I guess it was just so Milo could get his trailer seen by more people
04:32:19 <marshmallow> gah dang, his old videos..  such low quality camera.  I can't believe I used to watch that.  hahaha
04:35:55 <TheWhisper> yeah

09:58:11 <medos> good morning thejoot :)
09:58:33 <medos> how is this fine tuesday treating you?
09:58:49 <thejoot> harsh
09:58:51 <thejoot> lol
09:59:12 <thejoot> just found out i have an ad to make, its going into Vogue magazine and its needed by 5pm...........
10:07:49 <medos> :O
10:07:51 <medos> whoa
10:14:04 <medos> text in 100%K / 40%C , Typeface Bodoni, background White
10:14:06 <medos> done
10:15:46 <thejoot> yeah its not so much the text, its the image that i need to sort out, txt and all that will be done by vogue themselves, its only an 8x6cm ad space, still a little more notice for such a high end publication would be nice.
10:16:19 <medos> sounds tricky
10:16:52 <thejoot> i've just gota finish this html email shot then i can get cracking on it. It will be fine
10:17:14 <thejoot> stilll working on your laptop piece today?
10:17:30 <medos> i'd love to hear details but risking confidentiality and as such your job i have to surpress the urge to ask for further details ;)
10:17:39 <medos> oh, nah, I'm not working on that at all at the moment
10:18:30 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/IgH7E.jpg
10:20:09 <medos> i have more than enough unfinished private for fun stuff flying around to go back to

10:23:11 <thejoot> ohhhhh that reddit stuff looks AWESOME!
10:23:17 <thejoot> nice nice work mate, really nice
10:23:22 <thejoot> i can tell you stuff
10:23:53 <medos> some of the guys in here are rather careful when mentioning where they work and what they do
10:23:57 <thejoot> im the Digital and Creative director for the EU for a company called KONG.  www.kongcompany.com
10:24:34 <medos> whoa
10:24:51 <medos> I remember my sister having one of those for her dogs.
10:25:00 <thejoot> yeah they are amazing toys
10:25:12 <thejoot> probably the best known dog and cat toy brand in the world.
10:25:46 <thejoot> my title is probably a bit misleading, its me and one other person so its not like i have a whole team of creatives under me or anything.
10:26:32 <medos> Still fits though, you're the boss ;)
10:28:09 <medos> seems to be a good position to be in though, rather have a small team and do some stuff
10:28:30 <medos> instead of commanding 20 people around with no actual hands on time anymore
10:28:37 <medos> that's my opinion on that though
10:29:35 <medos> http://www.kongcompany.com/de/products/fur-hunde/airdog/ <- are these immune to be ripped apart in one bite?
10:32:55 <medos> sidenote: i hope you're using http://mailchimp.com/features/

10:39:11 <Sat> sry i wasnt around last few days for the challenge
10:39:16 <thejoot> but pretty tough
10:39:22 <thejoot> hi Sat

10:44:55 <medos> lol sat
10:44:58 <medos> that's awesome
10:48:14 <Sat> haha thanks 
10:49:04 <medos> makes an AD
10:49:08 <medos> points out it's an AD
10:49:10 <medos> great
10:49:12 <medos> uhhhhm
10:49:25 <medos> there wasn't really anyone else who participated
10:49:34 <medos> but i'll make one so you're not all alone
10:50:06 <Sat> forver alone :(  (no longer!)
10:51:52 <thejoot> i'll participate in the next :)
10:52:27 <medos> the next one will get tricky
10:52:50 <thejoot> give us a clue
10:55:25 <thejoot> right, time to do this vogue ad....
10:55:31 <thejoot> i'll check back in a bit
10:56:16 <medos> good luck
10:56:38 <medos> the basic idea i had was making something and posting it to reddit (without anouncing that it's a challenge)
10:56:43 <medos> so the guy with most upvotes wins
10:57:02 <medos> example:
10:57:18 <medos> Make a GIF for http://www.reddit.com/r/woahdude
10:57:56 <medos> in this case everyone would have to make a gif that he thinks would appeal to the guys on woahdude, then find a good post title and post it
10:58:44 <medos> making a gif is not really fitting though, i'm trying to find something else where this would work
10:59:14 <Sat> i like it, thats a good idea
10:59:39 <medos> it could easily be continued and repeated each time
10:59:44 <medos> different subreddit to post to
10:59:47 <medos> different goal
11:00:42 <medos> evade reddit with specifically tailored content
11:00:47 <medos> *invade even
11:01:53 <medos> photoshoop a tweet by a famous guy
11:01:54 <medos> haha
11:02:06 <Sat> there are different ways of tackling it, you could try and make great content or you could use do some "market reaserch" and post something that you think will get a shit load of traffic
11:02:18 <medos> exactly
11:03:39 <medos> let's say we'd do this with http://www.reddit.com/r/microsoft/
11:03:45 <medos> you could do a rebrand
11:03:56 <medos> i could do an interface improvement i would want to see
11:04:13 <medos> someone entirely else photoshoops bill gates to the stage of an apple event
11:04:42 <medos> endless approaches, plenty of subreddits to take a stab at
11:05:06 <Sat> yup i think its a really fun idea
11:05:45 <medos> biggest advantage is that there'll be an unbiased jury
11:07:04 <Sat> the 1st thread i ever submitted on reddit went to no.1 of subreddit it was on. i thought oh thats cool this reddit this is easy. 
11:07:12 <Sat> never happened again :p
11:08:47 <medos> haha
11:09:08 <medos> i have made like 10 posts or something
11:09:14 <medos> two got very popular
11:09:23 <medos> one of those is a nsfw gif so don't stalk my post history
11:10:01 <Sat> ye ive done ~<10
11:10:39 <Sat> did you post to upload some footage of yourself to ladyboners ;)
11:11:38 <medos> friend of mine uploaded a boobie gif and was proud that it got 10k views
11:12:18 <Sat> only 1 thing can rival porn on the net in terms of searches i think
11:12:20 <medos> he seriously linked me his imgur stats for that image every day
11:12:25 <Sat> Cats
11:12:38 <Sat> lol
11:12:42 <medos> then i thought i could confuse him by posting it in nsfw_gifs
11:12:52 <medos> turns out it got 100k views without him knowing why at first
11:12:56 <medos> fun times
11:13:02 <medos> fake account is now my main account
11:14:58 <medos> i've had so many accounts, now i'm stuck with champ-ooh due to managing this irc room
11:15:00 <medos> :(
11:15:06 <medos> oh well
11:16:30 <Sat> you get that from a character in Ranma 1/2?
11:18:41 <medos> nah, i just didn't take a shower for two days and as such thought about shampoo
11:18:45 <medos> which i thought was funny
11:18:50 <medos> the more i thought about the word
11:20:11 <medos> it's like fake poop
11:20:13 <medos> .u sham
11:22:36 <medos> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shampoo_(Ranma_%C2%BD)#Shampoo
11:22:40 <medos> why am i reading this
11:29:42 <medos> "Shampoo is strong enough to casually walk through reinforced stone walls on a regular basis"
11:29:45 <medos> spot on
11:31:10 <Sat> random fact, In Ireland "Crack" means have a laugh. "i'll do it for the Crack" means something very different over there
11:39:53 <medos> .define colloquial
11:43:43 <medos> .u crack
11:44:22 <medos> Sat "I'm cracking up" was known to me
11:44:33 <medos> but having a crack
11:44:37 <medos> i never heard
11:47:07 <Sat> same, when i started working for an irish client it was very confusing :p
11:59:05 <medos> it can work the other way around too though
11:59:23 <medos> i made some stuff for a dj in london
11:59:30 <medos> and he constantly slashed out slang
11:59:41 <medos> so when he said "dude i'm rolling right now"
11:59:46 <medos> i thought he meant
11:59:48 <medos> .u rolling
12:00:27 <medos> turns out he was just rolling tobacco into a cigarette

12:22:32 <Sat> well im slightly confused by it
12:23:00 <medos> hm
12:24:24 <medos> Ever dealt with corporate logos?
12:24:37 <medos> I've had this quite regularly

12:26:16 <medos> corporate official coca cola logo file with red stroke
12:26:43 <medos> people add strokes and drop shadows and other nonsense to logos sometimes
12:26:46 <medos> that should not happen
12:29:17 <Sat> idd
12:29:57 <medos> i have this happen myself
12:30:06 <medos> have two elements, want to add stroke to one of them
12:30:16 <medos> and whoopsies both have a centered 1pt stroke
12:32:34 <sigstuff> well if you convert a stroke whats the issue
12:32:56 <sigstuff> subtle drop shadows dont hurt

12:36:44 <sigstuff> that outerglow sucks
12:36:52 <sigstuff> bvecause there's too much of it
12:37:10 <medos> that's subjective
12:39:06 <medos> next guy who handles the logo file adds a drop shadow
12:39:09 <medos> next one a gradient
12:39:27 <medos> next adds a two pt green stroke
12:40:44 <thejoot> nasty
12:40:53 <medos> subjective
12:40:54 <medos> :p
12:42:55 <medos> i like my 2pt green strokes on mah logos
12:43:14 <thejoot> http://imgur.com/jqy0l
12:43:38 <Sat> anyone know if you can get your vector shapes to align to the pixel grid in photoshop?
12:43:45 <Sat> wihtout using the grid
12:44:21 <medos> ?iphone
12:44:24 <medos> ?ios
12:44:49 <medos> actions and workflows
12:44:50 <medos> look at those
12:45:10 <medos> http://bjango.com/articles/actions/
12:45:30 <medos> the custom tool panel isn't bad either, a handy button for pixel snapping on/off
12:46:07 <medos> thejoot add a 2pt green stroke please :D
12:46:10 <medos> i like those
12:47:07 <thejoot> hah, ok medos
12:47:18 <medos> aligned to center
12:47:36 <Sat> Enable Pixel Snapping (F15) and Disable Pixel Snapping (shift-F15) 
12:47:43 <Sat> These enable and disable Snap Vector Tools and Transforms to Pixel Grid in Photoshop CS6. Please note that you need Photoshop CS6 for these actions to function. I probably use these 50 times a day.
12:47:58 <Sat> thats perfect except CS6 >.< doh
12:48:10 <Sat> another reason to upgrade
12:48:35 <thejoot> omg, youve made the brand stand out so much more! http://imgur.com/V7EMd im just getting in touch with the director to change everything
12:49:17 <medos> LOL
12:49:25 <medos> i love it
12:49:42 <medos> the top right thing looks like a speech bubble
12:49:44 <medos> Sat http://dmonzon.com/freebies/12-photoshop-tools/
12:50:19 <medos> oops, no pixel snapping
12:51:49 <Sat> oh thats usefull though cheers
12:52:04 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/mIan8.png <- this is what the action does, maybe photoshop cs5 supports this?
12:52:10 <medos> just record one yourself
12:53:50 <Sat> cs5 doesnt have the function "snap to pixel grid" so you have to make a 1 pxiel "grid" and then "snap to grid" it's a work around. cs6 would be easier. but its no biggie
12:54:02 <medos> oh
12:54:04 <medos> aight
12:54:43 <medos> make an action that turns your grid to a 1px pseudo grid
12:54:53 <medos> and make an action that turns your grid back to what you use again
12:54:59 <medos> same thing i guess
12:56:02 <Sat> ye that would be it
12:56:30 <medos> works in cs6
12:57:56 <medos> i should stop posting on reddit
12:58:08 <medos> for three months
12:58:11 <medos> whee

13:04:20 <Sat> done
13:04:44 <medos> check cs5 folder :p

14:52:13 <marshmallow> occassionally
14:53:13 <medos> reddit made me numb in terms of valuing buttonclicking like an actual like or dislike
14:54:23 <medos> i also almost clicked like on the pic of a girl
14:54:31 <medos> because TheWhisper liked it
14:54:39 <medos> dodged a bullet there
14:54:48 <marshmallow> lol
14:54:58 <medos> thejoot i will look at what i thumbs'd up and give an actual comment on it in a bit :)
14:55:02 <marshmallow> true, I'm pretty like-button happy
14:55:11 <marshmallow> especially for youtube videos
14:55:14 <medos> yeah
14:55:18 <marshmallow> before it even loads, I usually give an upvote
14:55:23 <medos> it's more like a "this did not ruin my day" button
14:55:40 <marshmallow> lol
14:56:55 <thejoot> champ
14:57:03 <thejoot> can i get a dribble inv?
14:58:18 <medos> right now i have one left
14:58:30 <medos> and i'm keeping that one for a situation where someone seriously works on getting better
14:59:21 <medos> that being said, i barely know you so i can't tell if you're improving or not
14:59:22 <medos> :P
14:59:35 <thejoot> ah ok, no probs i will wait a while or soemthing
15:01:00 <medos> invites are given out on a basis of how much stuff i make is liked
15:01:08 <medos> and how much stuff is liked my invited guys make

15:12:25 <thejoot> THANKS
15:14:50 <marshmallow> ooh, that's a good idea
15:14:59 <sigstuff> lol medos 
15:15:07 <sigstuff> i try to avoid drop shadows if i can
15:15:21 <medos> i wasn't saying drop shadows are bad
15:15:40 <medos> i was saying drop shadows on a logo are bad
15:16:10 <sigstuff> why?
15:16:39 <sigstuff> if you can reproduce a monochrome version, and keep another version with all the raster effects you wanna throw in, that doesnt sound bad 
15:16:59 <medos> true
15:17:22 <medos> that would lead to more problems though
15:17:30 <medos> if it's a logo other people have to handle someday
15:18:34 <medos> thejoot http://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/xkkd7/any_fellow_redditors_can_invite_me_to_the/c5n94zo
15:18:47 <sigstuff> oh god dribble invites
15:18:56 <sigstuff> ive cmpletely ignored dribble just for this fact
15:19:06 <sigstuff> besides dribble never gives any productive critique
15:19:07 <medos> same
15:19:10 <sigstuff> its always " AWESOME"
15:19:13 <medos> i've got an invite randomly
15:19:19 <medos> no it's not always awesome
15:19:27 <sigstuff> i havent seen negative comments ever
15:19:28 <medos> it just shows the popular stuff first
15:19:37 <medos> it's a site to show wip
15:19:49 <medos> unless it's specified people do not want critique
15:20:21 <medos> 3 people writing awesome on a piece that got viewed 1000 times means 997 did not liked
15:20:28 <medos> *like it
15:21:46 <sigstuff> or 997 didnt care
15:22:06 <sigstuff> also the viewcount like behance is based on even unregistered users
15:22:15 <sigstuff> i think..
15:22:23 <sigstuff> because it counts for any and all views
15:22:40 <marshmallow> if you're only a prospect, you can't comment
15:22:42 <marshmallow> right?
15:22:45 <sigstuff> so if you're not registered you cant leave a comment but the view is taken into account
15:22:45 <medos> correct
15:22:50 <medos> yes
15:22:55 <medos> i was just giving an example
15:23:00 <sigstuff> which sucks though
15:23:05 <marshmallow> so, not necessarily 997 people don't like it =p
15:23:09 <sigstuff> right
15:23:17 <marshmallow> yea, there's been multiple times I wish I could comment =/
15:23:19 <sigstuff> not entirely sure of dribble
15:23:24 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/t9pP0.png
15:24:04 <medos> it's kind of enjoyable when you follow a few people who make stuff that fits your style
15:24:37 <marshmallow> dunno.  it's not bad #'s of views
15:24:48 <medos> lol
15:25:00 <medos> i don't really care about the data
15:25:08 <medos> bought pro to upload an attachment
15:25:27 <marshmallow> oooooooh!  you need to be pro to add attachments?!
15:25:42 <medos> yeah
15:25:42 <marshmallow> no wonder so many of the posters I was looking at didn't have the full poster...
15:25:49 <medos> no that's not it
15:25:54 <marshmallow> awww
15:26:46 <medos> the posters you were looking at showed what typeface, texture, color and effects that poster uses
15:26:55 <medos> which would be enough to give a like
15:27:03 <medos> regardless of what the poster actually says
15:27:32 <sigstuff> behance is way better for this
15:27:40 <sigstuff> you cant put up case studies and stuff on dribble can you
15:27:59 <medos> not really
15:28:04 <medos> was never meant to be that way
15:28:07 <sigstuff> right
15:28:22 <sigstuff> also doesnt tell you the tools used does it?
15:28:31 <medos> dribbble?
15:28:33 <sigstuff> ye
15:28:46 <sigstuff> cause i remember some dude who made this basketball
15:28:51 <medos> who cares, it's about designers showing uniformly 400x300 pixels of what they are working on
15:28:53 <sigstuff> and we all assumed it was a full vector
15:29:00 <medos> if they want to share how it's made they will
15:29:06 <sigstuff> and he got all this praise for ahwile until someone popped in the question
15:29:20 <sigstuff> and he was like " oh i did it using a 3d app"
15:29:25 <medos> yeah ;)
15:29:58 <marshmallow> lol
15:30:38 <Sat> will my entry for the howlowcanyougo contest get me an invite http://i.imgur.com/dPa1T.jpg !
15:31:09 <medos> sigstuff http://i.imgur.com/Ahbci.png
15:31:44 <medos> look up ^ i posted links where you can try
15:31:46 <medos> :P
15:31:54 <sigstuff> whats that?
15:32:02 <sigstuff> i read it but im not following it
15:32:29 <medos> http://cameronmoll.com/archives/000043.html
15:32:34 <medos> how dribbble started basically
15:32:44 <medos> check date of post
15:33:56 <medos> http://www.scoutzie.com/
15:34:08 <medos> try to get invited to that place
15:34:42 <medos> or http://yayhooray.com/
15:34:49 <medos> or http://forrst.com/posts
15:34:58 <marshmallow> so...  many =_=;;
15:35:12 <marshmallow> the exclusity is semi-annoying me now
15:35:18 <medos> why?
15:35:25 <sigstuff> im curious
15:35:26 <sigstuff> http://www.scoutzie.com/iphone/Entertainment/radio-ios-icon
15:35:27 <sigstuff> in that
15:35:33 <sigstuff> you see the very small strokes there
15:35:42 <sigstuff> and the type in the middle
15:36:02 <sigstuff> is that like blurred?
15:36:15 <medos> lol
15:36:15 <sigstuff> shouldnt it cause some anti aliasness when scaled so small?
15:36:49 <sigstuff> cause it looks pretty clean from here
15:36:54 <sigstuff> even at that size
15:37:06 <medos> you just explained why prospects on dribbble can't comment
15:37:28 <sigstuff> ye bu im curious
15:37:35 <sigstuff> how did this guy achieve that?
15:37:44 <sigstuff> is that a photoshop thing?
15:39:39 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Hfl5R.png
15:39:47 <medos> what area are you talking about?
15:39:59 <sigstuff> the dial
15:40:02 <sigstuff> the blue portion
15:40:07 <sigstuff> and the purple
15:40:15 <sigstuff> those little lines up there
15:40:29 <sigstuff> i see no jaggedness even at that size
15:40:40 <medos> yup
15:40:48 <sigstuff> how do you achieve that?
15:40:54 <medos> many ways
15:40:56 <medos> hm
15:41:23 <sigstuff> well in vector if you put strokes that close at 0.5pt/stroke, its going to look jagged when scaled down
15:42:13 <sigstuff> or there's a better way to do it?
15:42:35 <sigstuff> unless it's some ps mangling which im curious about too
15:42:35 <medos> there must be if the guy did it
15:42:49 <sigstuff> blur?
15:42:54 <medos> maybe
15:42:59 <medos> maybe opacity
15:43:02 <medos> maybe both of those
15:43:05 <sigstuff> ah opacity
15:43:07 <medos> maybe an unsharp mask added to that
15:43:22 <medos> maybe a fireworks 50% scaledown because fireworks is king in scaling down properly
15:43:36 <sigstuff> ohye i need to play with fireworks more
15:43:53 <medos> maybe he actually has two 1pt lines and rotated them accordingly so they overlap one being dark one being bright at a certain opacity
15:44:14 <sigstuff> ye
15:44:26 <medos> maybe he added a sliiiight tiny radial blur
15:44:28 <sigstuff> ye opacity makes sense
15:44:31 <medos> to a copy of that layer
15:44:36 <medos> maybe he
15:44:48 <medos> just did what he does usually
15:45:08 <medos> try and fail till he figures it out
15:45:12 <sigstuff> app icons these days are just crazy
15:45:42 <medos> it's fun to make them though

15:48:18 <medos> yeah

15:48:22 <nazbot-pc> :)
15:48:28 <nazbot-pc> happy?
15:48:31 <medos> did you make a list of words/terms/database stuff?
15:48:32 <medos> definitely
15:48:40 <medos> for german translation?
15:48:43 <marshmallow> what did you sell?
15:48:51 <nazbot-pc> no, I haven't had any time to do anything fridge pal related
15:48:55 <medos> fridge palu ^_____^
15:49:01 <nazbot-pc> http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fridge-pal-shopping-list-expiry/id496451091?mt=8
15:49:19 <nazbot-pc> what the

15:49:29 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/NyL66.png
15:49:31 <marshmallow> ooh!  nice =D
15:49:32 <medos> indeed they are
15:49:35 <nazbot-pc> thats annoying
15:49:36 <marshmallow> i didn't know the two of you did it together
15:49:45 <medos> lol
15:50:06 <marshmallow> now make android version!
15:50:07 <marshmallow> =p
15:50:16 <nazbot-pc> ugh grabbing my laptop to fix that
15:50:21 <nazbot-pc> yeah I wanna do android next
15:51:06 <medos> next week it'll be wp8 again
15:51:10 <medos> then droid again
15:51:14 <medos> then wp8 again
15:52:49 <medos> bah
15:52:58 <medos> btw. i have yet to come up with an app to make
15:53:19 <marshmallow> as in, you need an idea for an app?
15:53:20 <medos> because as it turns out solar kinda does what i thought would be cool
15:53:25 <medos> yeah
15:53:30 <marshmallow> oh
15:54:04 <nazbot-pc> right
15:54:06 * marshmallow shrugs
15:54:13 <nazbot-pc> yeah theres a lot of weather apps out there
15:54:21 <marshmallow> we have a weather app
15:54:23 <marshmallow> lol
15:54:24 <nazbot-pc> marshmallow, what apps would be REALLY simple to do
15:54:30 <nazbot-pc> but could have a cool design to them
15:54:33 <nazbot-pc> eg weather apps
15:54:38 <marshmallow> errrrm
15:54:43 <nazbot-pc> oh
15:54:47 <nazbot-pc> you know what i thought about
15:54:55 <nazbot-pc> what about a wiki-note taking type app?
15:55:07 <nazbot-pc> eg you can make hyperlinks to other notes
15:55:07 <medos> too complicated
15:55:12 <medos> THAT
15:55:18 <medos> sounds like www.hackpad.com
15:55:24 <nazbot-pc> that's really not very hard to do programming wise
15:55:30 <nazbot-pc> if the feature set is really simple
15:55:49 <nazbot-pc> I think :)
15:56:04 <nazbot-pc> I always wanted an app that I could take notes like that
15:56:22 <nazbot-pc> but the feature list would probably spiral out of control
15:56:33 <medos> see
15:56:41 <medos> that's where the part of complexity comes in
15:56:44 <medos> which i did not want
15:56:46 <marshmallow> eh, I had an app idea, but it looks like it's already been created
15:56:51 <nazbot-pc> yup yup
15:56:55 <nazbot-pc> whats the idea?
15:56:58 <nazbot-pc> we can do it better :)
15:57:54 <medos> OH
15:58:10 <medos> reminds me: you remember my comparison app idea?
15:58:20 <nazbot-pc> for picking a PC
15:58:22 <nazbot-pc> ?
15:58:47 <medos> yeah
15:58:53 <medos> someone did/is doing that
15:59:18 <nazbot-pc> ah
15:59:20 <nazbot-pc> yeah
16:02:20 <medos> btw.: stop posting in r/politics all the time
16:02:50 <medos> i spent the past three days commenting a shitton on design stuff on reddit and i feel empty inside now
16:02:59 <marshmallow> =(
16:03:04 <nazbot-pc> lol
16:04:30 <medos> brb food
16:04:39 <nazbot-pc> k
16:04:41 <nazbot-pc> me too
16:04:49 <nazbot-pc> just wanted to share my excitement about 15 sales :)
16:05:32 <medos> yeah, i felt better about fridge pal after looking at the appstore for a bit

16:05:47 <medos> brbrbrb
16:08:19 <nazbot-pc> wtf
16:08:24 <nazbot-pc> all of the screenshots are borked
16:08:29 <nazbot-pc> the ipad ones reverted
16:08:31 <nazbot-pc> stupid apple
16:08:46 <nazbot-pc> BTW medos, when you get back - one thing we might wanna do is spice up the screenshots a bit
16:08:58 <nazbot-pc> like a little ribbon or something talking about features for each
16:09:09 <nazbot-pc> e.g. point out what each screenshot does/means
16:09:12 <nazbot-pc> tastefully
16:20:29 <medos> .tell nazbot-pc http://i.imgur.com/0o9Kg.gif

18:06:46 <marshmallow> oh well
18:07:10 <marshmallow> 3.1 rating
18:07:16 <marshmallow> i'm very satisfied with that =D
18:12:20 <iasmatt> 3.1 rating on what?
18:13:28 <medos> on a scale i don't understand
18:13:31 <medos> (us-tv ratings)
18:13:36 <medos> Azra-el .showtells
18:13:44 <iasmatt> oh, ok?!
18:14:04 <medos> .g tv-show ratings
18:14:23 <iasmatt> i just got in the chatroom, so i can just see posts dating back to 8.04....
18:14:39 <medos> yup, that's why i explained it
18:14:59 <medos> marsh was satisfied that Revolution got a 3.1 rating
18:15:07 <iasmatt> yeah :)
18:15:27 <iasmatt> i was looking for what it was that was rated.. 
18:15:29 <iasmatt> thanks! :D
18:20:34 <marshmallow> <medos> on a scale i don't understand <- It's a number of viewers within the 18–49 age range.  Depending on what channel it is and what time it is will determine if that's a good number.
18:21:54 <marshmallow> For simplicity sake, Revolution was the highest rated American TV show out of everything on tv (including all the gazillion cable shows) on Monday night at 10p.

18:46:04 <medos> Thanks Dekthro ;)
18:46:22 <Dekthro> Haha
18:46:24 <Dekthro> Yeah it works perfect
18:59:53 <TheWhisper> IT was Medos
19:02:24 <marshmallow> =p
19:10:40 <TheWhisper> dammit 
19:10:40 <TheWhisper> I don't get how people can take 19 credits in college
19:10:40 <TheWhisper> and survive
19:10:40 <TheWhisper> this is fucking absurd
19:13:44 -!- iasmatt [~iasmatt@c83-255-4-29.bredband.comhem.se] has joined ##reddit-gd
19:14:14 <Dekthro> Not everyone does. Ha
19:14:29 <TheWhisper> I mean, I can get it in like a non-creative field
19:14:43 <TheWhisper> Where when you do homework, you know it's either right or wrong
19:15:00 <TheWhisper> But with creative classes, where it can take 10+ hours for an assignment
19:15:11 <TheWhisper> and then I have 6 assignments a week
19:15:21 <TheWhisper> + 20 hours of class
19:15:25 <Dekthro> Maybe set a time limit for yourself
19:15:41 <Dekthro> So you don't spend extra time tweaking to perfection, etc. etc.
19:16:14 <TheWhisper> Maybe
19:16:30 <TheWhisper> I just have a lot of trouble focusing on so many different assignments at once
19:16:38 <TheWhisper> I'm not good at switching between tasks like that
19:17:01 <medos> i'm still sure reddit and facebook and mainstream media news are not your problem
19:17:04 <medos> not at all
19:17:10 <TheWhisper> I'm sure they're not also
19:17:16 <TheWhisper> Considering that I barely spend any time on them
19:18:07 <Dekthro> Well learnign to work with a tight deadline now be better than later. Making design decisions based on time investment, compromise etc
19:18:23 <TheWhisper> Yeah
19:18:31 <TheWhisper> I mean, if I have one project and not 15 
19:18:33 <TheWhisper> I can do that fine
19:18:40 <TheWhisper> But then when I start out with 3 projects
19:18:47 <TheWhisper> and 4 more arise halfway through
19:18:55 <TheWhisper> and then 2 get their details changed
19:18:57 <TheWhisper> etc etc
19:19:03 <Dekthro> Try having like, a constant stream of 20-40 jobs a day ;P
19:19:14 <TheWhisper> I did that this summer
19:19:16 <Dekthro> (I dont finish that many in a day, ofcourse)
19:19:18 <marshmallow> <@TheWhisper> I don't get how people can take 19 credits in college <-- I'm pretty sure I did that
19:19:21 <TheWhisper> and as long as they followed each other
19:19:24 <TheWhisper> instead of overlapping
19:19:25 <TheWhisper> I was fine
19:20:56 <marshmallow> oh, nvm.  18 credits at worse.  (5 classes.  2 were science classes & 1 was a language class so they were 4 credits each.  others were 3)
19:21:14 <marshmallow> ya know how to do it?  COFFEE
19:21:15 <TheWhisper> Yeah, things like science or math or w.e
19:21:16 <marshmallow> lots of COFFEE
19:21:20 <TheWhisper> I have no problems with those classes
19:21:24 <TheWhisper> And I can't drink coffee
19:21:39 <TheWhisper> If they have concrete answers, I can do them easily in a short time
19:22:16 <medos> mo ti va ti on
19:22:28 <marshmallow> idk, I had only.. 3 "artsy" classes in college.  they were my fun ones / easier ones.  lol.
19:22:50 <marshmallow> ^^ including fine arts.  so, thus the quotations
19:23:27 <marshmallow> way easier then learning a 2nd language.  foreign languages are my worse =(
19:24:10 <Dekthro> So I found http://www.ononesoftware.com/products/perfect-mask/ yesterday, and sweet jesus
19:24:15 <Dekthro> saved me so much time
19:24:22 <Dekthro> Cutting shit out
19:24:33 <TheWhisper> And then I look at the stuff I'm learning in my creative classes
19:24:50 <TheWhisper> And I feel like it's all stuff I don't need to take a class to learn
19:24:54 <TheWhisper> like how to use Maya
19:24:56 <TheWhisper> and shit
19:25:28 <medos> TheWhisper the luxury of good education seems like a huge burden for you
19:25:42 <TheWhisper> It's not so much the luxury of it
19:25:46 <TheWhisper> It's the expectation of it
19:26:02 <medos> contemplating it will help
19:26:15 <TheWhisper> No it won't
19:26:22 <medos> Dekthro i'm glad that i rarely have to cut stuff out
19:27:40 <marshmallow> TheWhisper...  you need an app/program that disables your internet
19:27:47 <marshmallow> trust me, you'll be way more productive
19:27:52 <marshmallow> when you're not procrastinating
19:27:53 <marshmallow> =p
19:27:55 <TheWhisper> 1) have it
19:28:00 <TheWhisper> 2) use it
19:28:09 <TheWhisper> 3) doesn't really work
19:28:21 <TheWhisper> 4) it's not the procrastinating that's the problem
19:28:31 <TheWhisper> As I have, for the most part, stopped procrastinating
19:28:41 <medos> last half hour?
19:28:44 <medos> hour?
19:28:45 <TheWhisper> Working
19:28:50 <TheWhisper> + complaining

22:54:29 <medos> is too harsh
22:54:44 <medos> 60-80% opacity maximo

23:09:22 <Kocho> designing t-shirts for a start up and making 10% of profits aint much is it?
23:10:05 <Kocho> all pro-bono too
23:10:15 <Kocho> not sure if i should take it on as a side project or not
23:11:50 <medos> a t-shirt startup?
23:11:58 <Kocho> yep
23:12:17 <medos> how did you evade those before?
23:12:34 <Kocho> eh?
23:12:57 <medos> there are billions of those
23:13:04 <Kocho> yeah i know
23:13:05 <medos> i'm just wondering that you get asked now
23:13:11 <medos> .g ltdex
23:14:00 <Kocho> are you saying thats a better bet?
23:14:13 <medos> it's the only one i remember
23:14:13 <medos> wait
23:14:30 <Kocho> i've been thinking of starting my own, but i haven't looking into printing costs and all that
23:14:50 <Kocho> maybe not t-shirts, but a side project or something
23:15:39 <medos> (20:04:28) (makerbreakr): 1.80/2.20 is what they offer, I could do 3-5$

23:16:18 <zakmac> Jalapeño, in my eyes
23:17:19 <medos> i'm not recommending this guy
23:17:27 <Kocho> ok
23:17:29 <medos> i'm just saying that a startup
23:17:31 <Kocho> just an example
23:17:33 <medos> without any base
23:17:40 <zakmac> Their logo is off
23:17:42 <medos> is not really special in the shirt business
23:17:54 <Kocho> yeah
23:18:04 <zakmac> The rope circle inside the first circle isn't perfectly round, it comes too close in the lower left quarter

23:18:13 <medos> (21:14:45) (medos): except for the wordmark which is pissing me off, that does look like a solid base
