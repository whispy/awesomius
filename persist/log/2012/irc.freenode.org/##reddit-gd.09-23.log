03:01:14 <medos> lol
03:01:23 <zkamca> From the article of course, not rdt
03:01:41 <zkamca> medos: that icon looks great
03:01:52 <medos> thank you :)
03:02:16 <medos> i spent almost two hours tweaking the shabizzle around the stupid icon
03:02:41 <zkamca> The hell is a shabizzle?
03:02:50 <medos> .u shabizzle
03:03:10 <zkamca> ...
03:03:19 <zkamca> Where does he get definitions from?
03:03:24 <medos> urbandictionary
03:03:27 <medos> is .u
03:03:28 <edodes> shabizzle doesn't sound intelligent xD
03:03:33 <zkamca> Nice
03:03:37 <medos> .dictionary shabizzle
03:03:49 <medos> .define shabizzle
03:03:51 <zkamca> Vector trollface is vector
03:03:54 <medos> okay
03:04:25 <medos> i'm not even sure why that was in there
03:04:51 <zkamca> Good lord this dinner is tasty 
03:05:25 <zkamca> Flatbread rounds (like a tortilla of wheat break but thicker), garlic hummus, tomato, onion and spinach

03:09:08 <medos> .rem zakmac (@zkamca): .setdefinition AQ zak has fat fingers
03:09:12 <medos> LOL
03:09:32 <zkamca> Ha
03:11:03 <zkamca> Why am I still watching this damn video
03:12:07 <medos> to feel my pain?
03:13:09 <zkamca> Nah. While your work is very detailed I've long been under the impression your workflow is over complex in a lot of respects
03:13:43 <zkamca> Will say though, the jam jar is an impressive touch, I wouldn't have thought to make it look used
03:15:32 <medos> probably 80% of that video is figuring out how to make an app icon
03:17:01 <medos> point taken about overly complex workflow, i try to balance that with the goal to speed up said workflow :)
03:18:50 <zkamca> Mine is based off being lazy, purely lazy
03:19:20 <zkamca> I jump from ps to ai, you do not. This means your work when finished can be abused more in the future with else effort. But mine got out the door faster
03:24:55 <medos> jump from ps to ai?
03:25:44 <zkamca> Yes, a lot of what you did in AI I would've done in PS, mainly for time saving
03:25:54 <zkamca> Such as the jam jar and some texturing
03:27:55 <medos> ahh
03:28:14 <medos> to be fair i started to like photoshop a lot more after making that icon
03:28:27 <medos> nowhere close to illustrator still
03:28:36 <medos> but brushing some stuff a little
03:28:39 <zkamca> Right on. To each their own
03:28:40 <medos> is quite handy
03:28:55 <zkamca> This bad boy likes some variety in his life, and speaking in the third person apparently
03:30:51 <medos> Medos says: if photoshop had artboards and freedom in hotkey-customization i would value ai and ps equal
03:30:53 <medos> ly
03:34:11 <zkamca> .choose apple, different apple
03:34:20 <zkamca> Thought thats how it worked
03:34:32 <zkamca> .choose work on fuel nanny design, work on fuel nanny codebase
03:34:37 <zkamca> Woo, yay
03:35:14 <medos> .choose zakmac makes timelapse of it, zakmac works in peace
03:35:17 <medos> DANGIT
03:35:27 <zkamca> Hah
03:35:45 <zkamca> 90% of the video would be me deleting a 75% complete project 10x over
03:36:17 <zkamca> What was the app Quentarez made? I think I still have it
03:36:30 <medos> oh
03:36:33 <medos> voice tutor
03:36:43 <zkamca> No the little screenshot thingamabob
03:37:03 <medos> snappy?
03:37:09 <medos> screenshotty?
03:37:27 <medos> something similar to his divvy project
03:37:57 <zkamca> Oh snap, OSX has "Grab" built in
03:39:08 <zkamca> Fret not, I won't be time lapsing but I will keep you abreast of whats going on with screenshots
03:39:14 <zkamca> Frequently

03:40:44 <zkamca> I reinstalled a couple weeks back. Its not default though
03:41:04 <medos> says essentials @ top right
03:41:15 <zkamca> I'm happy to be arbitrarily told to design by some robot though. I haven't in so long
03:41:47 <zkamca> Thats just what blocks are loaded, not their layout

03:47:27 <zkamca> Something that's not currently there: you will be able to customize MPG estimates by selecting your actual car
03:53:51 <medos> i'll post what i have in half an hour
03:53:54 <medos> then i'll go to bed
03:53:58 <medos> half an hour should be enough
03:54:06 <zkamca> I'd hope
03:54:38 <zkamca> I'm ind of torn between workingg on the design or trying to get some of the heavy load off the javascript in terms of calculating numbers and displaying info and putting it into php.
03:55:00 <zkamca> I don't like how the page replaces values visibly

05:06:32 <medos> nono

05:08:35 <medos> after target
05:08:44 <medos> after the file
05:08:51 <medos> displaybrightnessconsole.exe
05:08:54 <medos> you add a 20
05:08:57 <medos> or 50
05:09:03 <medos> or 100 or 80 or 21 or 37
05:09:36 <medos> if it works that shortcut should adjust the brightness of your display (from 0 for lowest to 100 to highest)
05:09:59 <medos> so you make 3 shortcuts (if it works) with something like 20 , 50 and 100
05:09:59 <EDSGD> wtf
05:10:08 <medos> and those should give you different brightness
05:10:09 <EDSGD> can't find my brightness thing
05:10:16 <medos> where?

16:14:42 <TheWhisper> and Medos, is there anyway to run two separate dropbox accounts on a computer?
16:15:11 <EDSGD> Well I download a lot of crap and stuff so I started having the death loop when starting up.
16:16:05 <EDSGD> So I ended up fixing that problem, but when I did that I started getting the "non genuine windows" crap
