00:19:39 <medos> i stole ryanfords fries and made it bookmark homescreen-able with an app icon
00:19:42 <medos> yeah fugly
00:19:46 <medos> D:
00:19:55 <medos> *my app icon
00:19:57 <Kocho> oh nice
00:20:25 <medos> mail yourself that url, open on iphone with safari and add to home screen
00:20:51 <medos> should show the icon 1:1 exactly how it looks for the app
00:22:11 <Kocho> how do i add it to home screen?
00:22:36 <medos> if you have the site open in safari (ios safari)
00:22:43 <Kocho> yep
00:22:47 <medos> you can tap the bottom center bookmark button
00:22:54 <medos> and it'll show an option that says
00:22:58 <medos> "add to home screen"
00:23:00 <Kocho> oh yep got it
00:23:15 <Kocho> oh yeah
00:23:16 <Kocho> awesome

00:23:33 <Kocho> ;)
00:23:54 <medos> sounds like i achieved what i wanted to then
00:23:56 <medos> :P
00:24:02 <Kocho> :O
00:24:05 <Kocho> nah i like it
00:24:08 <Kocho> looks really good
00:24:22 <medos> it's an utility app
00:24:30 <medos> so being low-key is good
00:24:37 <Kocho> yeah
00:24:44 <Kocho> it looks friendly
00:25:23 <medos> heyyyyya
00:25:26 <medos> ?marshmallow
00:26:16 <Kocho> if you update that website
00:26:21 <Kocho> does it automatically update the icon?
00:26:56 <medos> not sure tbh
00:27:14 <medos> it should update if you open safari again and homescreen it
00:27:19 <medos> a second time with new icon
00:27:27 <medos> so it's not too much work
00:27:37 <Kocho> yep
00:27:42 <Kocho> just thought it might be dynamic
00:28:09 <medos> it remembers the icon but might change it when you open the website
00:28:24 <medos> e.g.: you run around for a week without clicking french frie
00:28:28 <medos> and it'll be the fridge
00:28:37 <Kocho> i might nick your code if thats ok
00:28:40 <medos> when i delete that folder in the meantime and you click it
00:28:48 <medos> lol that's 1:1 ryanford
00:29:06 <medos> he just had a weird tricky background css hidden icon thingie setting
00:29:21 <medos> i've already put the html+images in the shared folder
00:29:27 <Kocho> oh cool
00:29:28 <marshmallow> [20:25] <medos> ?marshmallow <- quÃ© pasa?

03:05:29 <medos> afaik american tv exists solely to fulfill your fetishes

05:36:49 <EDSGD> Anyone know a good heavy content website?
05:38:46 <Kocho> like news websites?
05:39:48 <EDSGD> Uhm Like IBM.

05:45:25 <jc_> hello
05:48:29 <EDSGD> hello jc_
05:50:48 <jc_> Can anyone offer an opinion on whether or not to join AIGA?
05:53:17 <EDSGD> Well its 50$ now.
05:53:26 <EDSGD> If you're a student JOIN.
05:54:13 <EDSGD> Go to the events 
05:54:27 <EDSGD> GO TO THE PORTFOLIO SHOW FOR SURE
05:54:37 <EDSGD> that might even land you a job.
05:54:44 <EDSGD> when you go to events talk to people
05:54:53 <EDSGD> talk to everyone.
05:54:58 <TheWhisper> You might even get laid ;)
05:55:03 <EDSGD> LOL
05:55:40 <EDSGD> Talk to professionals. Don't ask for their bussiness card it will make you seem desperate.
05:55:51 <EDSGD> Let them give it to you.
05:56:19 <EDSGD> If they do give you a business card. Be it a pro or a student.
05:57:07 <EDSGD> Send them an e-mail the following day telling them how great it was meeting them
05:57:08 <EDSGD> :D
05:57:40 <EDSGD> Next meeting you go or w/e talk to them again and again and again.
05:58:19 <EDSGD> Might help you land an internship if you later decide to seek one not matter how sucky you are lol
05:58:26 <EDSGD> intern non- the less.
05:59:15 <EDSGD> What also helps. Don't be afraid to contact studios.
05:59:44 <EDSGD> Contacting studios as a student will most likely lead to a response.
05:59:45 <EDSGD> Dpm
06:00:02 <EDSGD> Don't forget to state that you're a student.
06:00:23 <EDSGD> Tell them to critique your work blah blah blah
06:00:30 <EDSGD> :D
06:00:44 <EDSGD> All through AIGA bro
06:01:17 <EDSGD> Hope that helped jc_
06:02:01 <EDSGD> Oh also try and volunteer and stuff
06:02:23 <EDSGD> Other than that I fucking HATE THE AIGA
06:02:25 <EDSGD> :p
06:02:52 <jc_> hahahaha
06:03:11 <EDSGD> which branch are you joining?
06:03:31 <jc_> not exactly the closing sentence I thought would follow everything else
06:04:15 <jc_> Well I am a student, and I was wondering how beneficial, if at all, joining the AIGA would be
06:04:26 <EDSGD> LOL I'm still a member despite saying that. Non member prices for events are ridiculous 
06:04:39 <EDSGD> Yes JOIN
06:04:53 <EDSGD> Helps you get that foot in the door
06:05:28 <EDSGD> The KEY is networking.
06:05:38 <EDSGD> Which you can do with the AIGA
06:07:51 <EDSGD> :D
06:08:42 <TheWhisper> jc_ you have a site?
06:09:13 <jc_> Thats basically what I want to do at this point. I've come to a point now where I realized that I'll be graduating next semester and I'm behind.
06:10:06 <jc_> No I don't have a site...one of the reasons I'm "behind"
06:10:14 <EDSGD> Same here man. Student here too :p
06:10:17 <EDSGD> LOL
06:11:03 <TheWhisper> You have a site, ed
06:11:04 <TheWhisper> ya liarrr
06:11:11 <TheWhisper> jc_ can we see some work?
06:11:26 <Kocho> yeah, show us some stuff
06:11:28 <Kocho> ;)
06:11:45 <EDSGD> LOL The next part of his sentence. I'm out the door at the end of the year.
06:12:02 <EDSGD> jc_
06:12:17 <EDSGD> also add them on twitter and facebook
06:12:23 <EDSGD> and kiss ass
06:12:29 <EDSGD> not too much though
06:13:11 <jc_> I've basically gone through my student career without much direction, as I didn't really know where to search for it. I'm trying to make up for that now 
06:13:30 <EDSGD> AIGA has a job board
06:14:28 <TheWhisper> show us soooome werk
06:16:17 <jc_> Therein lies one of the problems, I have no site and have not uploaded work to any site.
06:16:29 <EDSGD> Do it NOW jc_
06:16:36 <TheWhisper> jc
06:16:39 <EDSGD> :p

06:18:11 <EDSGD> doesn't work.

07:36:45 <Kocho> hey medos
07:36:47 <Kocho> you there?
07:40:03 <Kocho> I'm working on the GUI and i need to get it done in like, a few hours so don't say anything about shadows.. what do you think - game buttons closer to thumbs or further? closer: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-14%20at%205.37.00%20PM.png further: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-14%20at%205.36.53%20PM.png
07:40:21 <Kocho> closer seems better, but i don't like how the trophies look in the middle
08:16:01 <Kocho> if you come back - nevermind
08:23:03 <medos> wheeee
08:23:05 <medos> i am here
08:23:09 <medos> what should i do?
08:23:14 <Kocho> its ok
08:23:15 <medos> nevermind or read?
08:23:21 <Kocho> nah dont worry
08:23:33 <medos> nevermind or read or don't worry? :D
08:23:48 <Kocho> any idea why illustrator stuff when you drag copy an art board shifts?
08:24:04 <Kocho> never mind & don't worry ;)
08:24:31 <medos> ai stuff tends to shift wheeeeeeen
08:24:50 <medos> any snap to pixel stuff
08:24:53 <medos> or pixel preivew
08:25:11 <medos> or snap to point (?) is activated
08:25:15 <Kocho> ahh yeah
08:25:16 <Kocho> thats it
08:25:18 <Kocho> thanks :)
08:25:40 <medos> i hope
08:25:55 <medos> can't guarantee that it helps
08:26:02 <Kocho> yeah it does
08:26:16 <medos> you'd also have to make sure that the dragged artboard is fitting with da' grid
08:26:23 <medos> global r uler
08:26:24 <medos> grid
08:26:27 <medos> huzzah
08:26:56 <medos> btw.: for your two screenshots
08:27:34 <medos> gut reaction: the second one looks better
08:27:45 <Kocho> ugh
08:27:48 <Kocho> yeah didn't go with that
08:28:04 <Kocho> lol
08:28:34 <medos> i looked at them for 3 seconds each and tried to make a valid suggestion
08:28:48 <medos> isn't the whole thing a little dark?
08:29:06 <medos> or will it get blingbling dynamic shading effects by your dev?
08:29:15 <Kocho> i hope bling bling
08:29:19 <Kocho> because i think it might be
08:29:26 <Kocho> but i feel like I'm too far in to start again
08:29:40 <medos> yeah, i wasn't saying start over :P
08:30:17 <medos> i was just saying that the shadows feel a bit like they would be strongah on gamma 1.8 screens
08:30:25 <Kocho> yeah
08:30:28 <Kocho> dont care
08:30:29 <Kocho> lol
08:33:51 <Kocho> i never make opacity masks in ai
08:34:00 <Kocho> i am going to now.
08:34:40 <medos> are you making a reflection? :P
08:34:48 <Kocho> yeah sort of
08:35:35 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/IFpuw.png
08:35:44 <medos> remember
08:35:51 <Kocho> I'm just writing iMac and then making a reflection
08:36:05 <medos> that when you somehow for some reason can't edit the fuck out of anything
08:36:19 <medos> that you are very likely just in mask edit mode
08:36:29 <Kocho> yes
08:36:30 <Kocho> d
08:36:33 <Kocho> had that feeling just then
08:36:38 <Kocho> was likeâ¦ wtf have i done
08:36:42 <medos> i fucked that up for 5 minutes before realizing why the fuck i was unable to move stuff
08:36:53 <medos> once a week or so
08:37:02 <medos> lol
08:37:20 <medos> might happen again
08:37:29 <Kocho> haha
08:37:36 <Kocho> yeah i can imagine
08:38:44 <Kocho> i don't know how you live without LiveView
08:39:02 <medos> lol
08:39:20 <medos> i'm seriously able to gauge that shit beforehand now
08:39:30 <medos> example: app icon
08:40:01 <medos> i mean the handle might still suck and the shape of the door is controversial
08:40:10 <Kocho> controversial
08:40:11 <Kocho> lol
08:40:41 <medos> but the colors work and the icon itself fits
08:42:12 <Kocho> thats true
08:42:25 <medos> i can achieve liveview by squinting a little so everything looks 15% darker
08:42:31 <medos> and zooming out to 50%
08:42:32 <Kocho> haha
08:42:40 <Kocho> thats true
08:42:45 <Kocho> you can get a good idea by zoom
08:44:50 <Kocho> you should see my end of game screen
08:44:58 <Kocho> oh shiii forgot some text
08:46:22 <medos> shouldn't text be added engine/code-wise anyway? :P
08:46:27 <medos> or just the look of the text
08:48:09 <Kocho> umm
08:48:13 <Kocho> this is just a screen at the end
08:48:17 <Kocho> says Round Over!
08:48:54 <medos> so what part of Round Over! did you forget?
08:49:02 <Kocho> saying round over :(
08:49:14 <medos> at least the ! is there
08:49:57 <Kocho> :D
08:51:38 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-14%20at%206.50.46%20PM.png what do you think? sorry about the text looking funny
08:51:42 <Kocho> still uploading..
08:52:09 <Kocho> thought i'd brighten it up a bit :D
08:52:29 <medos> derp
08:52:33 <medos> there are two buttons
08:52:45 <medos> I am delighted.
08:52:56 <Kocho> i didn't decode that
08:52:58 <medos> not sure how the whole thing looks on device
08:53:01 <Kocho> what do you really think
08:53:13 <medos> if it's that bright
08:53:31 <medos> your watch needs some glass-gloss at least
08:53:45 <medos> or something that is not blunt grey
08:53:53 <medos> with such a strong red-white gradient in the back
08:53:54 <medos> like
08:53:54 <Kocho> for the main timer?
08:53:58 <medos> yeah
08:54:09 <medos> the gradient in the back is intennnnnnnnnnnnse
08:54:15 <Kocho> ok
08:54:25 <Kocho> I'm pretty happy with it on screen
08:54:58 <medos> white on white: Read It!
08:54:58 <Kocho> anyway
08:55:04 <Kocho> yeah
08:55:09 <Kocho> its not too bad though
08:55:29 <Kocho> ill tone it down a bit
08:55:36 <medos> haven't checked on-device might work out okaaaaay
08:56:24 <medos> logo: glossy, three playing chip element button thingies: glossy
08:56:40 <medos> center thingie : flat
08:57:01 <medos> buuuuut he might add some dynamic maybeshmaybe
08:57:16 <medos> hard to judge game stuff without having played/tested/seen it live on device and moving at all
08:57:20 <Kocho> i think ill just send it to him, see what he thinks
08:57:28 <Kocho> yeah i know
08:57:39 <Kocho> ill ask him again if he wants more testers
08:57:42 <medos> so i guess your judgement comes from "played this shit for weeks"
08:57:56 <Kocho> he hasn't put much of what i've made on
08:58:03 <medos> well, you're close to done
08:58:26 <medos> no need to ask
08:58:33 <medos> in the end he'll expect feedback D:
08:58:35 <Kocho> yeah, but i get the feeling we're putting it together and then we'll do checks
08:58:53 <Kocho> but its not going to be anything revolutionary
08:59:05 <Kocho> the game itself has barely changed
08:59:19 <medos> .u resolutionary
08:59:26 <Kocho> lol
08:59:35 <medos> y u no apple
08:59:58 <Kocho> ugh i cbf anymore
09:00:03 <Kocho> i just want to send this
09:00:34 <medos> now you understand the ios vibe
09:00:46 <Kocho> i've learnt my lesson :(
09:01:53 <Kocho> i have to make the screens wider for iPhone 5
09:02:28 <medos> i lucked out
09:02:44 <medos> with nazbot being "fuck landscape"
09:02:51 <medos> imma just make portrait mode
09:03:03 <Kocho> haha
09:03:07 <Kocho> yeah thats good
09:03:13 <Kocho> but wouldn't it still need to be bigger?
09:03:53 <medos> that's the cool part
09:04:11 <medos> he said "yeah we'll need new assets for iphone5"
09:04:19 <medos> "it'll have black bars on the side"
09:04:26 <medos> "because it increased in width"
09:04:27 <Kocho> lol
09:04:56 <medos> long story short: he knows that the new iphone is taller now
09:04:58 <medos> not wider
09:05:09 <medos> so same tabbar navbar status bar
09:05:14 <medos> just bigger listview
09:05:20 <medos> and new main screen gradient
09:05:24 <Kocho> ahh ok
09:05:26 <medos> all the same except for 2-3 files
09:05:27 <medos> <3
09:05:31 <Kocho> cool
09:06:13 <medos> NNNNNNNNNOOOOO
09:06:30 <Kocho> !?
09:06:31 <medos> .tell EDSGD I MISSED CREATIVE MORNING WITH SPIEKERMAN IN BERLIN D:
09:06:43 <Kocho> =[
09:07:05 <medos> it's a 1hour talk and half day discussion with awesome guys,
09:07:27 <medos> the german creative mornings have a verrrrry tiny amount of awesome guys
09:07:30 <medos> just missed one
09:08:19 <Kocho> so you didn't miss it all?
09:09:01 <medos> no, i would've visited berlin for the actual talk
09:09:13 <medos> i can still watch it online on vimeo sometime later this week
09:09:27 <medos> but those talks usually involve several hours of Q&A and so on
09:09:41 <Kocho> oh yep
09:10:16 <medos> not saying German designers are boring but more often than not they end up giving their talks abroad
09:10:47 <medos> last event in Berlin was some mid 40's lady talking about her art gallery
09:11:40 <Kocho> i don't like art galleries

10:12:03 <Kocho> how am i going to export this to him
10:12:12 <Kocho> i know!
10:12:23 <Kocho> ill just resave it as a new document and delete what i don't want
10:12:25 <Kocho> genuis
10:14:04 <medos> save each artboard as separate file
10:14:08 <medos> checkmark
10:14:12 <Kocho> serious?
10:14:17 <medos> not sure
10:14:17 <Kocho> oh
10:14:18 <Kocho> yeah
10:14:19 <Kocho> i dunno
10:14:21 <medos> depends on what you have in there
10:14:22 <Kocho> im not sure
10:14:48 <medos> it helps decluttering as it only grabs what's ionside and bordering on an artboard
10:14:49 <Kocho> thats a good idea
10:14:52 <medos> layers will still intact
10:14:57 <Kocho> http://i.imgur.com/Yy2Y1.png
10:15:23 <Kocho> i have 1 layer per artboard
10:15:25 <medos> shifting boxes he said
10:15:34 <medos> idgaf about grid alignment he said
10:15:45 <Kocho> the grid is on
10:15:50 <Kocho> omg
10:15:50 <Kocho> medos
10:15:55 <Kocho> i don't care ffs
10:15:56 <Kocho> lol
10:17:48 <medos> enough to ask me why your content was shifting
10:18:00 <Kocho> thats true
10:18:04 <Kocho> i don't care *now*
10:18:05 <Kocho> :D
10:20:07 <Kocho> I'm just sending one
10:20:56 <Kocho> damn
10:21:01 <Kocho> still have to do the icon
10:21:03 <Kocho> forgot about that
10:23:44 <medos> which one did he like again?
10:24:20 <Kocho> im sending

10:29:09 <medos> confused as hell about drop shadow on /!\
10:29:15 <Kocho> same here
10:29:17 <Kocho> dont care
10:29:19 <Kocho> right now
10:29:25 <Kocho> i think it has to be behind or something
10:29:40 <medos> yeah
10:29:49 <medos> well
10:29:51 <medos> no?
10:29:59 <Kocho> yeah
10:30:00 <Kocho> i dunno
10:30:02 <medos> the problem is that you gave the whole shape a depth bevel
10:30:04 <Kocho> it's like maybe, maybe not
10:30:09 <medos> to go innnnnnnnnnsssssiiiiddddeee
10:30:22 <medos> but the shadows on the /!\ and discs
10:30:32 <medos> indicate it's frontview
10:30:48 <Kocho> i know what you mean
10:30:54 <Kocho> it's not correct
10:31:01 <medos> the big fat white highlight is the problem i think
10:31:02 <medos> but
10:31:04 <Kocho> i really think it's just the one below the /!\
10:31:06 <medos> i know the feeling
10:31:15 <medos> of "nnnnnnnnngggggh"
10:31:26 <medos> and then 10000 comments on tiny things
10:31:36 <medos> "yaya i know it's wrong leave me alone"
10:31:55 <medos> kudos for making it a lot more chrome-y
10:32:24 <Kocho> he liked the border
10:32:29 <Kocho> i liked the border for the new one i made
10:32:30 <medos> not even sure if you changed anything but last time it seemed more like a childrens toy border
10:32:37 <Kocho> yeah it was
10:34:19 <Kocho> ok medos
10:34:21 <Kocho> im done
10:34:25 <medos> wheee

12:35:23 <medos> Sat_ http://www.bestvendor.com/best/all-products
12:35:25 <medos> one more page
12:35:28 <medos> to look at
12:35:34 <medos> didn't link it yesterday ;(
12:37:23 <Sat_> cool, usefull
12:37:28 <Sat_> thanks
12:38:19 <Sat_> only use 2 things on the list at the moment
12:39:05 <medos> some adblockers might kill the functionality of that page
12:40:27 <medos> it's not just one list it's several categories
12:42:39 <Sat_> i guess i meant the top of the list before you "load more"
12:43:06 <Sat_> i just saw this on my Facbook Feed.... https://dl.dropbox.com/u/18046184/Picture%202.png
12:44:12 <Sat_> literally made me recall in horror
12:45:14 <medos> yup
12:45:18 <medos> that's why i don't use fb
12:47:17 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/wfedP.png
12:47:19 <medos> hooray
12:47:37 <Sat_> i barely use it
12:48:42 <Sat_> i like, is it your design?
12:49:27 <edodes> alright, another question: almost finished with a logo, what files do you give the client? They have specifically asked for the ai/eps file so that they can change the colors around....
12:52:04 <edodes> I'd honestly like to just give them a pdf since I said all they're getting is a logo, would it be ok to ask for an extra charge for the ai file? I'm afraid they'll start changing things and would rather not have my name attached if they do
12:53:21 <medos> why are you dealing with this mid-project?
12:53:38 <edodes> because it was a favor :(
12:54:18 <medos> Sat_ nope, i just threw a reddit heavy load pic on a tshirt
12:54:32 <medos> mh
12:54:51 <Sat_> needs to be a bit higher up the t-shirt imo
12:55:53 <medos> edodes if you leave any questions open when starting something be prepared that they're going to answer them in their favor
12:56:19 <medos> Sat_ i didn't save it
12:57:21 <edodes> they just asked "will it be possible to play with the colors once I download it(logo)", hoping that gives me a bit of wiggle room...
12:57:25 <Sat_> could you give them the ai/eps and just tell them that if they make any changes you dont want to be credited. Their request wont cost you any time/money
12:58:35 <edodes> yeah, I guess I'll have to
12:58:59 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/dwNPV.png
12:59:23 <medos> lol

13:03:38 <medos> i don't have to
13:03:52 <medos> shitting on people who aren't good is easy
13:03:57 <medos> getting better takes actual work

14:20:15 <Russ3001> Hi medos! I have a simple doc with a logo and text all I want to do is change the background colour, I've done it using doc setup , grid colors, simulate colored paper, it changes the color but it covers the text/logo , I'd like it to be underneath?
14:20:41 <medos> Russ3001 what version of Illustrator are you using?
14:20:57 <Russ3001> cs5
14:21:16 <medos> Do you know how Artboards work or what they are?
14:21:44 <Russ3001> nah
14:22:36 <medos> Essentially Artboards are areas that get exported.
14:22:51 <medos> This is important because there's no background color in Illustrator.
14:23:31 <medos> You would just need to make a box on the lowest Layer that covers the entire artboard and lock that layer.
14:24:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/pIq58.png
14:24:43 <medos> Sorry for the color of the interface but CS5 does it the exact same way, just without the black interface. ;)
14:25:14 <medos> I hope that made a little sense. :|
14:25:52 <medos> Each Artboard = A new "Save For Web and Devices" area.
14:25:58 <medos> jeeebus
14:26:40 <Sat> lol
14:28:21 <edodes> did you scare him off? :/
14:28:38 <edodes> also: is that cs6?
14:28:42 <medos> Yes.
14:28:48 <edodes> it looks so pretty
14:28:59 <medos> I even used a default workspace to not confuse him too much.
14:29:05 <edodes> heh
14:29:21 <edodes> hope he figured it out
14:30:58 <marshmallow> [10:18] <medos> ?marshmallow <-- why does the telephone image pop up all the time?

14:31:27 <medos> marshmallow because you said you still have and use your landline. :-P
14:31:32 <medos> Could be worse.
14:31:35 <medos> ?kocho
14:31:39 <marshmallow> yea, but most of them are cordless

14:59:37 <medos> + discussion about makin' typefaces with knowledgeable people?

15:21:14 <EDSGD> At least in the pieces he uses tape in.
15:21:34 <EDSGD> What are your thoughts on it?
15:21:36 <medos> I thought why the fuck did Jessica B I E L switch to artitstÃ© stuff.
15:21:41 <medos> hahaha
15:21:46 <EDSGD> LOL
15:21:57 <EDSGD> I saw the same thing.
15:22:00 <EDSGD> :3
15:22:10 <medos> *artistÃ©
15:22:26 * medos curses Freud
15:22:39 <EDSGD> Other than I noticed that HORT pulls inspiration from Paul Butler as well.
15:22:44 <EDSGD> *pulled
15:23:17 <EDSGD> .u curses Freud
15:23:23 <EDSGD> :/
15:24:09 <medos> .u Freudian Slip
15:24:44 <EDSGD> ooooo000000hh TIL
15:27:20 <EDSGD> Hey yesterday I noticed that vending machines no longer accept pennies
15:28:42 <medos> dfffffffuck
15:28:51 <EDSGD> .u penny
15:29:00 <EDSGD> .u pennies
15:29:07 <EDSGD> :(
15:29:20 <EDSGD> Not the definitions I was expecting
15:29:26 <EDSGD> .u penny currency
15:29:35 <EDSGD> :D
15:30:19 <medos> "Jessica B I E L switch to artitstÃ© stuff."
15:30:26 <medos> had problems with my keyboard
15:30:47 <medos> that would be the most precise freudian slip there is
15:31:02 <medos> .d penny
15:31:19 <medos> .define penny
15:31:28 <medos> there you go
15:31:53 <EDSGD> This one is better "penny: the most uselessly annoying piece of currency in existence. Their primary use is to throw at people when you're bored"
15:33:12 <medos> To be fair it is kind of annoying. :-P
15:33:40 <medos> Finland doesn't use 1 and 2 cent coins at all, they just tend to round the price.
15:34:12 <medos> Less cents, less clutter, less organization costs.
15:34:31 <EDSGD> Finland sounds so progressive
15:36:17 <medos> considering that i have a box full of cents
15:36:19 <medos> yeah
15:43:08 <EDSGD> wtf lol xD
15:43:28 <EDSGD> That PSY Gangnam style guy is at New York singing it
15:43:35 <EDSGD> too popular and mainstream
15:43:51 <EDSGD> Good for him for breaking through to a global audience
15:49:51 <medos> Without gawker and facebook i never really had to care about him.
15:49:52 <medos> :P
