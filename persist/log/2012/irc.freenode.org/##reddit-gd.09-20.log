01:20:42 <Kocho> backinaction
01:21:18 <medos> 12 minutes for ios sixoes
01:21:24 <medos> for the download at least
01:21:42 <Kocho> you've got a 4 don't you medos?
01:21:45 <Kocho> not a 4s?
01:22:03 <medos> lol
01:22:08 <Kocho> most of the features are for a 4s+
01:34:37 <Kocho> anyone used PDF2ID?
01:37:17 <medos> pdf to indesign?
01:37:56 <medos> sounds like a horrible idea D:
01:39:06 <medos> outlined fonts, missing fonts
01:39:11 <medos> realignemnt
01:40:14 <medos> open illustrator
01:40:19 <medos> drag a pdf file inside of an empty doc
01:40:27 <medos> and hit "embed" in the top left

01:56:05 <medos> i'll let you know if testflight still works

02:17:15 <Kocho> medos want to try pick out a logo/
02:17:34 <medos> out or on?
02:17:42 <medos> out of what?
02:17:45 <medos> the pdf?
02:17:48 <Kocho> it was a pdf
02:17:51 <Kocho> by itself
02:17:55 <medos> what did you do to it
02:17:58 <zakmac> Developer wiped the only copy of 5MinuteMystery in existence back to the original...
02:18:01 <Kocho> nothing
02:18:06 <medos> D:
02:18:11 <medos> zakmac why?!
02:18:31 <medos> and how can there be only one copy
02:18:37 <zakmac> He was angry that I was running behind on the design (though he did literally nothing for this version beyond bothering me)
02:18:43 <zakmac> I was working off dev
02:18:58 <zakmac> Because a live copy on my machine is impossible due to how he has the db configured
02:19:18 <zakmac> Jokes on him, I just finished all the javascript while I was at work today and was going to implement it
02:20:04 <medos> D:
02:20:08 <Kocho> i don't think it'll be possible medos because it's an image by the look of it :(
02:20:30 <zakmac> Meh, it sucks because I liked the design but if he's gonna be like that I don't want involved anyway
02:20:40 <medos> use it for something else
02:20:44 <medos> 6minutemystery
02:20:50 <zakmac> I was doing this probono 
02:21:12 <zakmac> Which should amply explain the lax pace I've been taking
02:21:37 <medos> make a web ZakMcKracken
02:21:55 <medos> with those popups
02:22:10 <zakmac> Nah, time to work on FuelNanny now
02:22:13 <medos> nah just kidding, i'd keep the basic look and js stuff and definitely offer/use it elsewhere
02:22:18 <zakmac> That was next in line anyway
02:24:48 <medos> your projects have the weirdest names
02:25:18 <medos> Douchef, FuelNanny, SuckerDucker
02:28:13 <zakmac> SuckerDucker was an awesome name
02:28:39 <zakmac> Something must be lost in translation from English to GermanEnglish
02:28:49 <medos> nope i grasp all of those
02:29:06 <medos> i just didn't expect fuelnanny
02:29:13 <medos> lol
02:29:55 <zakmac> A friend came up with it while we were high
02:30:19 <zakmac> I didn't want something ending in "ly", since those sites are soon to go the way of "web 2.0"
02:32:20 <zakmac> Also own gasnanny though
02:32:47 <medos> lol
02:33:24 <medos> that sounds like a mean murder plan
02:33:39 <medos> and a petrol carry appliance
02:33:46 <medos> and a smelly babysitter
02:33:55 <zakmac> You smell like a dirty european
02:34:37 <medos> .u gas
02:35:24 <medos> not insulting just listing the associations i get from that name
02:35:30 <medos> which makes it overal hilarious
02:38:50 <zakmac> "Shit-flavored" how delightful
02:39:34 <Kocho> gas nanny
02:39:35 <Kocho> lol
02:39:49 <Kocho> what about

03:03:24 <TheWhisper> zakmac what's gasnanny
03:09:01 <zakmac> It'll be a site to get fuel cost info for a road trip based off average gas mileage for cars nowadays, unless a afferent make/model is specified by the user
03:09:07 <zakmac> Tons of these already exist
03:09:36 <zakmac> Basically a pet project that involves a lot of things I don't exactly know so I can learn. And, of course, do it better than everyone who already tried
03:15:45 <IAmLegend> this interests me

09:13:31 <medos> https://aboutmybrowser.com/gCLgPwpL
09:13:38 <medos> Same with FF.
09:13:52 <zakmac> I'm currently entering the government auto info into a databse
09:14:04 <zakmac> 1 of 1,136 items from 2013 entered
09:14:13 <zakmac> Only 34 years more after that
09:14:13 <medos> Manually? D:
09:14:34 <zakmac> Yeah, they aren't in a standard format. Some CSV, some plain text, some .xls
09:14:50 <zakmac> I'm going to see about handing off the DB and info to someone and paying them to do this
09:14:54 <zakmac> It'll take me weeks
09:16:21 <medos> fiverr.com
09:16:39 <medos> simple repetitive data entry go fiverr.com
09:17:05 <medos> I also seem to rememberrrrrr
09:17:07 <medos> some tool
09:17:08 <medos> wait
09:19:06 <medos> hm, not sure how helpful this would be but google drive (spreadsheet)
09:19:19 <medos> allows you to download a spreadsheet as csv or xls
09:20:01 <medos> not sure how to go from there to be honest but i used that to copy paste plain text lines
09:20:05 <medos> to a spreadsheet
09:20:12 <medos> then downloaded that as xls table
09:20:19 <medos> meh
09:22:03 <medos> if data entry is trickery i'd say fiverr
09:33:44 <zakmac> Hmm, yeah google converting to a CSV just might work for some of these years
09:33:52 <zakmac> Then just some simple cleanup afterward...
09:34:05 <zakmac> I literally just finished a single entry right now
10:08:43 <zakmac> Alright, 20/862 for 2013 entered. Time to get some sleep before work. Later
10:08:51 <medos> oh dear
10:08:56 <medos> good night man
10:09:17 <medos> i'd invest some time into finding an easier way to do this

17:07:44 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/uEErD.png
17:07:46 <TheWhisper> that is absurd
17:09:21 <TheWhisper> How about we fucking rehabilitate people
17:09:25 <TheWhisper> instead of ostracizing them
17:14:54 <medos> how likely is it that this is going to pass?
17:15:02 <medos> and turn into valid law?

17:15:08 <medos> iooops
17:15:10 <medos> TheWhisper
17:16:22 <marshmallow> not likely
17:16:25 <marshmallow> that sounds expensive!

17:17:15 <medos> "The law requires the Indiana Department of Education, in collaboration with organizations that have expertise in dating violence, domestic violence and sexual abuse to develop or identify model dating violence educational materials and model dating violence response and reporting policies." ?
17:17:30 <medos> is this related?
17:18:08 <marshmallow> idk anything about heather's law -.-
17:18:15 <marshmallow> though, I don't live in Indiana
17:18:17 <medos> http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb331
17:18:39 <medos> I'm none the wiser.
17:18:43 * medos goes back to work
17:19:03 <marshmallow> looks like it's JUST in Indiana for now
17:20:17 <medos> I'm generally confused because all i'm seeing is a law that passed
17:20:50 <medos> which falls under the "How about we fucking rehabilitate people"
17:20:53 <medos> category
17:33:54 <TheWhisper> Medos
17:33:59 <TheWhisper> The law hasn't passed yet
17:34:25 <medos> who is voting on it?
17:34:28 <medos> and why?
17:34:31 <medos> and when?
17:36:24 <TheWhisper> http://openstates.org/nj/bills/215/S331/
17:38:47 <TheWhisper> http://readability.com/articles/rt1dhajt
17:39:20 <medos> what changed today?
17:39:43 <TheWhisper> nothing
17:39:49 <TheWhisper> http://dailyorange.com/2012/09/in-the-name-of-justice-student-pushes-for-heathers-law-against-domestic-violence-in-memory-of-cousin/
17:40:03 <TheWhisper> The school paper just wrote a story about this girl
17:40:05 <TheWhisper> who is supporting it
17:40:11 <TheWhisper> because her cousin was killed by an ex
17:40:37 <medos> so your screenshot was absolutely out of context?
17:41:55 <TheWhisper> Yes, it lacked the context of the article.
17:42:20 <TheWhisper> But my taking it out of that context doesn't change the bill's text itself.
17:42:22 <TheWhisper> Or its purpose.
17:42:49 <medos> Two sponsors for this bill
17:43:18 <medos> how many sponsors does a bill usually have?
17:43:52 <TheWhisper> It depends
17:44:08 <TheWhisper> Sponsors are just the senators who have the idea for the bill
17:44:42 <TheWhisper> Small bills like these wouldn't have that many sponsors
17:45:10 <TheWhisper> whereas something big like sopa had
17:45:14 <medos> How many bills are in that status of being written and submitted but not yet passed any of the required steps?
17:45:17 <TheWhisper> 23 cosponsors
17:45:25 <TheWhisper> Well
17:45:31 <TheWhisper> This bill is just in the new jersey state legislature
17:45:38 <TheWhisper> not in the US legislature
17:45:45 <TheWhisper> So
17:45:59 <TheWhisper> http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/bills/billsbynumber.asp
17:45:59 <medos> Showing 1 to 10 of 2371
17:46:07 <TheWhisper> nah
17:46:11 <TheWhisper> 5725
17:46:20 <medos> okay
17:46:22 <TheWhisper> wait
17:46:24 <medos> how many of those pass?
17:46:28 <TheWhisper> Mine says 
17:46:37 <TheWhisper> Total records: 5725
17:46:37 <TheWhisper> Page 1 of 573 
17:46:47 <medos> http://openstates.org/nj/bills/?chamber=upper&session=215&page=1
17:46:50 <medos> Scroll down.
17:47:04 <TheWhisper> Ah
17:47:10 <medos> How many of those pass?
17:47:17 <medos> On average.
17:47:19 <TheWhisper> Not many
17:47:29 <marshmallow> are you against the bill?
17:47:34 <TheWhisper> actually
17:47:51 <medos> I'm just trying to put this random snippet into context.
17:48:01 <TheWhisper> http://www.smoaky.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=108696
17:48:14 <TheWhisper> need to find a better source than that though
17:48:33 <medos> And that's for all states combined.
17:48:36 <medos> hm
17:48:50 <TheWhisper> http://www.govtrack.us/blog/2011/08/04/kill-bill-how-many-bills-are-there-how-many-are-enacted/
17:48:57 <TheWhisper> No
17:49:00 <TheWhisper> not for all states combined
17:49:08 <TheWhisper> That's for the us congress
17:49:12 <TheWhisper> which is not the states combined
17:49:14 <TheWhisper> it's separate
17:49:25 <medos> No Major Action = Sitting there for next year?
17:49:37 <marshmallow> idk, this Heather Law doesn't sound too bad
17:50:02 <marshmallow> basically it's a way for cops to check if people are following restraining orders 
17:50:20 <medos> I'm not even wondering about the content.
17:50:34 <TheWhisper> Basically it's a way to treat people with anger problems and shitty living conditions like pets with collars.
17:50:53 <TheWhisper> Instead of helping them to contribute to society.
17:51:19 <marshmallow> i think my female instincts is why i like this bill XD
17:51:22 <TheWhisper> And medos, bills that have had no major action
17:51:27 <TheWhisper> need to be reintroduced the next year
17:51:32 <TheWhisper> but introducing a bill is easy
17:51:52 <TheWhisper> I think taking the easy way out is why people like this bill :)
17:51:55 <medos> ok so likelyness of this happening = very low right now
17:52:05 <TheWhisper> Eh
17:52:06 <medos> that's all i wanted to know really
17:52:09 <TheWhisper> Not really
17:52:16 <TheWhisper> It could easily pass
17:52:24 <TheWhisper> In NJ at least
17:52:39 <TheWhisper> If Megan's Law could pass for the entire nation
17:52:41 <TheWhisper> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan%27s_Law
17:52:47 <TheWhisper> This could easily pass in Jersey
17:52:54 <medos> How many bills do you investigate and follow each day?
17:53:05 <TheWhisper> Very few
17:53:37 <medos> aye
17:53:42 <TheWhisper> lol
17:53:47 <TheWhisper> From the wiki on megan's law:
17:53:48 <TheWhisper> "One senator has suggested that sex offenders in each jurisdiction be ordered to report to their local jail on October 31 (Halloween) of each year to protect children from being abducted during "this night of intentional identity confusion""
17:53:52 <TheWhisper> That's hilarious lol

19:15:11 <marshmallow> [15:08] <Sat> amazon sent me double parcels of some design books i ordered <- return one =D

19:23:19 <TheWhisper> those german ones
19:23:54 <Sat> i love books
19:23:59 <TheWhisper> me too
19:24:10 <medos> what books?
19:24:14 <medos> the ones i have?
19:25:04 <medos> those are by several authors with tons of revisions each year where each author knows what he's doing
19:25:28 <medos> i just don't feel the need to read books where one guy presents an idea or concept of something being done this or that way

19:29:37 <TheWhisper> Medos, I don't see the difference
19:29:45 <TheWhisper> In both cases, you can't take what they say at face value
19:29:56 <TheWhisper> You still have to think about it critically either way.
19:30:43 <medos> wat
19:31:16 <TheWhisper> I mean, yes, there is a difference in terms of what information is presented
19:31:24 <medos> How LCD screens work and what kind of paper there is and what kind of pantone/hks swatches are out there
19:31:30 <medos> if i have to doubt that
19:31:34 <medos> i don't know
19:31:41 <medos> i don't trust anything anymore i guess
19:31:47 <TheWhisper> no
19:31:48 <TheWhisper> I meant
19:31:57 <TheWhisper> You have to think critically about both
19:32:07 <TheWhisper> But not the same type of thinking
19:32:08 <TheWhisper> Like
19:32:20 <TheWhisper> One is about whether the theory has weight and validity
19:32:22 <TheWhisper> and the other is
19:32:26 <TheWhisper> how to apply the information
19:32:35 <TheWhisper> But I think if you just read the fundamentals without also reading theories and ideas about said fundamentals
19:32:39 <TheWhisper> you limit yourself
19:32:47 <medos> i do?
19:32:55 <medos> oh dear
19:33:02 <TheWhisper> by 1) only thinking from your own point of view and not acknowledging others
19:33:10 <TheWhisper> and 2) essentially reinventing the wheel 
19:33:26 <medos> 3) by doing stuff instead of applying 20 theories to my own workflow
19:33:30 <Sat> nice vid, yup they are objects of desire, for many reasons also
19:33:30 <TheWhisper> It's like becoming a philosopher without first studying what has already come before
19:33:57 <TheWhisper> "I've thought about this for 30 years and I believe that we can measure moral rightness by the consequences of an action!"
19:34:15 <TheWhisper> "erm, that's called consequentialism and that's been in existence for thousands of years."
19:34:19 <medos> would i be a better designer if i had read 20 more books now?
19:34:29 <medos> or 10?
19:34:31 <medos> or 30?
19:34:34 <TheWhisper> I wouldn't say better
19:34:36 <TheWhisper> I'd say different
19:34:41 <medos> in a good way?
19:35:04 <medos> or would i watch out at every step to not repeat history because book x told me so
19:35:15 <medos> maybe i wouldn't
19:35:18 <medos> maybe i would
19:35:21 <medos> who knows
19:35:28 * medos puts on philosopher hat
19:35:39 <Sat> i think you would be a better designer
19:36:11 <TheWhisper> It's a waste of time to reinvent the wheel when it already exists
19:36:23 <TheWhisper> I'm not going to spend my time making a usable ipad gui stencil
19:36:23 <medos> am i reinventing the wheel?
19:36:28 <TheWhisper> if someone else has made one
19:36:39 <medos> lol
19:36:43 <Sat> reading more books implies gaining more knowledge. As long as you still have time to apply that knowledge you will improve
19:36:59 <medos> i thought it's work when you're young, teach when you're old
19:37:11 <TheWhisper> learn when you're young
19:37:12 <Sat> and learn your whole life
19:37:18 <TheWhisper> ^ even better
19:37:19 <TheWhisper> :P
19:37:22 <medos> learning by doing?
19:37:26 <medos> if so huzzah
19:37:28 <medos> i'm doing that
19:37:53 <TheWhisper> Partially
19:37:55 <Sat> knowledge can save you time in doing also
19:38:15 <TheWhisper> ^
19:38:16 <medos> failure can make me appreciate what i did wrong a lot more and see it in a different light rather than just following rule x
19:38:29 <TheWhisper> You're missing the point
19:38:34 <medos> point being?
19:38:34 <TheWhisper> It's not about /following/ rule x
19:38:41 <TheWhisper> It's about /knowing/ rule X
19:38:56 <TheWhisper> and then deciding whether you want to apply rule X in specific situations
19:38:57 <medos> example?
19:39:02 <Sat> or knowing technique X
19:39:04 <TheWhisper> I have a grid
19:39:07 <TheWhisper> Should I break the grid
19:39:10 <TheWhisper> or stay on it
19:39:19 <medos> lol
19:39:21 <TheWhisper> I have display type
19:39:31 <TheWhisper> Rules say keep it tightly spaced
19:39:45 <TheWhisper> but I can break the rule and space it widely for a better effect
19:39:51 <TheWhisper> and so on
19:39:53 <medos> what is a better effect?
19:39:59 <TheWhisper> Who knows
19:40:01 <medos> in this case?
19:40:05 <medos> i thought you do
19:40:06 <medos> D:
19:40:16 <TheWhisper> In this imaginary hypothetical and super vague situation
19:40:16 <TheWhisper> no
19:40:18 <TheWhisper> I don't
19:40:19 <TheWhisper> lol
19:41:06 <medos> dangit
19:41:22 <medos> i think a few years at a paper have taught me enough about grids
19:41:32 <medos> and spacing and tracking and leading
19:41:59 <medos> it's not like i don't read anything anymore but if i do it's not some 60 year old concept about grids that might not be up to date anymore
19:42:03 <medos> just because the guy was famous
19:42:27 <TheWhisper> But you learned about them
19:42:28 <TheWhisper> at the paper
19:42:37 <TheWhisper> from /other people/
19:42:39 <Sat> they taught you about how you did it there. but if you studied papers from across the world wouldnt that make you better ?
19:42:46 <TheWhisper> Just because they taught you verbally how to do it
19:42:55 <TheWhisper> that's no different than learning how to do it from a book
19:43:00 <medos> i learned to look at stuff for more than 5 seconds
19:43:00 <TheWhisper> except in your case you could ask questions
19:43:09 <medos> which should suffice
19:43:20 <TheWhisper> Huh?
19:43:26 <TheWhisper> What's the relevance?
19:43:38 <medos> lol
19:43:39 <medos> nothing
19:43:41 <medos> reading is enough
19:43:44 <medos> carry on
19:44:11 <TheWhisper> You consistently seem to think that I have no attention span lol
19:44:22 <TheWhisper> If that's what you're referring to
19:45:09 <medos> lol
19:45:15 <medos> not this time
19:45:37 <medos> if i make an app interface
19:45:46 <medos> i don't make an app interface and think about what x and y wrote about it
19:45:52 <medos> i use other apps
19:45:57 <medos> and snapshot certain screens
19:46:00 <medos> look at shit
19:46:15 <medos> try apps just to navigate or inspect the interface
19:46:22 <medos> why do i like this?
19:46:27 <medos> why do i dislike that?
19:46:30 <TheWhisper> Yes, and by that, you learn about the beliefs of other designers
19:46:33 <TheWhisper> through their designs
19:46:36 <medos> no wai
19:46:45 <medos> it's almost like reading stuff they never wrote
19:46:46 <TheWhisper> There's no difference
19:46:50 <medos> by looking at what they do
19:46:51 <TheWhisper> Except in the manner of communication
19:46:52 <medos> instead of say
19:46:54 <medos> ;)
19:47:01 <TheWhisper> It's the same thing lol
19:47:13 <medos> what if the guy never wrote a book?
19:47:13 <TheWhisper> 4
19:47:26 <TheWhisper> The design tells a story
19:47:32 <TheWhisper> just as much as if he has writtten a book instead
19:47:35 <TheWhisper> *had
19:47:42 <medos> so me looking at design
19:47:51 <medos> counts as reading about design?
19:47:57 <medos> am i free to tab back to illustrator?
19:48:25 <TheWhisper> Lol
19:48:38 <TheWhisper> That's not what the topic was about though
19:49:03 <TheWhisper> It was about fundamental data (e.g. how an eye processes information) vs theories of how to take advantage of that data
19:50:47 <medos> fundamental data = i know how i can apply shit i look at and learn from
19:51:29 <medos> i have books that tell me how different printing techniques work
19:51:34 <medos> and i look at pix
19:52:14 <TheWhisper> I need a needle and thread
19:52:38 <medos> sorry for not valuing designers that are commonly known
19:52:49 <medos> more than the average joe who made something awesome
19:55:03 <TheWhisper> That's not what I was saying
19:55:04 <TheWhisper> at all
19:55:06 <TheWhisper> and you know that 
19:55:20 <TheWhisper> Okay let's say I need to tie a knot to hold something 
19:55:44 <TheWhisper> I can 1) look at different types of knots and how to tie them and their tensile strength
19:56:02 <TheWhisper> 2) read a book by someone about which knots have been found to work best in which situations
19:56:17 <TheWhisper> or 3) do both and then think critically about what I've learned and apply my new knowledge
19:57:11 <medos> who is someone in this case?
19:57:33 <TheWhisper> A knotologist
19:57:50 <Sat> a boy scout
19:58:00 <TheWhisper> LOL
19:58:05 <TheWhisper> knotology is not the study of knots
19:58:08 <TheWhisper> it's
19:58:16 <TheWhisper> "the art of creating spheres from strips of paper"
19:58:16 <TheWhisper> hahaha
19:58:35 <medos> what if said knot is for a present for my gf?
19:59:10 <TheWhisper> Apparently the study of knots is 'nodeology'
20:00:23 <TheWhisper> Medos, that doesn't change anything.
20:00:23 <TheWhisper> If you want to hold up a boat with a knot
20:00:23 <TheWhisper> or some shit
20:00:23 <TheWhisper> it doesn't matter why
20:00:23 <medos> if i look at a logo
20:00:23 <medos> i can recreate it
20:00:23 <medos> if i can look at a knot
20:00:23 <medos> i can recreate it?
20:00:23 <medos> if i'm really interested in knots
20:00:24 <medos> i look at knots all day?
20:00:26 <medos> inspect them?
20:00:29 <medos> compare them?
20:00:33 <medos> look what they're tied to?
20:00:35 <TheWhisper> Looking at them won't tell you which are better in certain situations
20:00:38 <medos> and collect that data?
20:00:42 <TheWhisper> And yes, you can test them all yourself
20:00:49 <TheWhisper> to determine which work better in certain situations
20:01:07 <TheWhisper> but instead of spending that time, you could read a thing from someone who has already tested them
20:01:08 <Sat> afai can tell the debate is medos is saying their is no benifit for him in looking at how knowledge as been applied, only the pure knowledge is usefull?
20:01:31 <TheWhisper> I think it's just him attempting to distract me from doing work lol
20:01:39 <medos> neither
20:02:39 <medos> if i read a book written by one guy
20:03:02 <medos> does that mean his statements are true?
20:03:29 <TheWhisper> No
20:03:37 <TheWhisper> It means you take his considerations into account
20:03:42 <TheWhisper> "During burning crusade I was living in an apartment, with no heat in one of the coldest winters here and broken windows. We couldn't afford food and lived off saltines and peanut butter. Never showered because it was too cold. It's not worth it, and I bulked up to 460lbs (estimating scale would only go so high)."
20:03:42 <TheWhisper> wow
20:03:44 <TheWhisper> That's depressing
20:04:10 <medos> is there a list of people to take into account and people to not take into account?
20:04:18 <Sat> it means you've gained knowledge you didn't have before, either through his teachings/work or by thinking about it critically
20:04:29 <TheWhisper> Medos, you take into account by thinking about it
20:04:44 <TheWhisper> Like
20:04:56 <TheWhisper> You're essentially discounting going to school
20:05:07 <TheWhisper> as all you're learning there is other peoples' theories on things
20:05:07 <medos> nope
20:05:12 <TheWhisper> so why even go to school
20:05:22 <TheWhisper> You can just experiment on everything yourself
20:05:32 <TheWhisper> and spend your entire life doing that
20:05:38 <TheWhisper> or learn what people have already found out
20:05:42 <TheWhisper> think about it critically
20:05:44 <medos> lol
20:05:48 <TheWhisper> and find new ways to apply and explore that knowledge
20:07:04 <medos> name one case where you did this
20:08:11 <Sat> easier to name cases where i havent :D
20:08:18 <TheWhisper> yeah
20:08:19 <TheWhisper> really
20:08:25 <TheWhisper> Because I do it every day
20:08:33 <medos> apply rules
20:08:38 <TheWhisper> Think about rules
20:08:42 <medos> i am
20:08:49 <TheWhisper> and whether they should be applied in specific situations
20:08:55 <medos> i do
20:08:56 <TheWhisper> not just apply them willy-nilly
20:09:06 <TheWhisper> okay
20:09:13 <TheWhisper> So how did you learn these rules that you think about?
20:09:43 <medos> in books?
20:09:49 <medos> and i decided i have enough rules?

20:13:05 <medos> wb
20:13:31 <Sat> thats a specific area you are talking about. You still look at what what other people have done and learn from it all the day, its impossible not too. it's inpiration!
20:13:34 <marshmallow> <@TheWhisper> so why even go to school <-- dunno.  I didn't XD
20:14:09 <medos> that's what i said in the first place
20:14:14 <medos> that i look at stuff
20:14:22 <medos> and feel that i get enough from doing so
20:14:32 <Sat> your just saying you have enough of a specific type of knowledge
20:14:49 <Sat> such as muller's grids :p
20:15:26 <TheWhisper> whoops
20:15:28 <TheWhisper> okay
20:15:29 <TheWhisper> so
20:15:34 <TheWhisper> so medos
20:15:37 <TheWhisper> you're saying
20:15:42 <TheWhisper> that you /did/ learn from others
20:15:49 <TheWhisper> and then you decided you had learned enough 
20:15:53 <TheWhisper> and wanted to go on your own
20:16:12 <Sat> had enough of a specific area of knowledge* 
20:16:30 <TheWhisper> And that's essentially what I'm saying
20:16:32 <TheWhisper> Learn from others
20:16:41 <TheWhisper> and then think about it and make it your own
20:16:46 <TheWhisper> And yes, you can do that your entire life
20:16:49 <TheWhisper> but you don't /need/ to
20:16:54 <TheWhisper> You just need to do it at some point
20:16:56 <medos> i don't?
20:16:58 <TheWhisper> to "catch up" so to spea
20:17:01 <TheWhisper> *to speak
20:17:05 <Sat> another semantic debate
20:17:09 <medos> :P
20:17:14 <TheWhisper> They're the best kind ;)
20:18:07 <TheWhisper> Oh my
20:18:16 <medos> how would this apply to musicians?
20:18:21 <TheWhisper> http://patents.stackexchange.com/?utm_source=Contextly&utm_medium=RelatedLinks&utm_campaign=AroundWeb
20:18:23 <TheWhisper> This could be
20:18:26 <TheWhisper> revolutionary
20:18:33 <medos> does one need to know all approaches to creating music to make better music?
20:19:03 <TheWhisper> Sometimes
20:19:18 <Sat> no, one needs to listen to some dubstep to make some dubstep
20:19:24 <TheWhisper> Unless you're like that autistic deaf kid who is a music prodigy despite having never heard one before
20:19:38 <TheWhisper> This patent crowdsourcing thing
20:19:40 <TheWhisper> could be really good
20:19:44 <TheWhisper> LOL
20:19:46 <TheWhisper> medos
20:19:49 <TheWhisper> second one I see
20:19:51 <TheWhisper> "pantry management"
20:19:57 <TheWhisper> http://patents.stackexchange.com/questions/240/pantry-management
20:20:05 <Sat> the more you know about whats out there, the more music you can make. applies to anything
20:20:13 <marshmallow> <medos> how would this apply to musicians? <-- just gotta know the basics really.  then you can be super awesome
20:20:21 <TheWhisper> false
20:20:26 <medos> true
20:20:28 <TheWhisper> false
20:20:31 <medos> true
20:20:35 <marshmallow> false to me?
20:20:35 <medos> ;)
20:20:42 <TheWhisper> http://www.everythingisaremix.info/
20:21:07 <marshmallow> i mean, just cause you know the basics too, you need shitloads of practice
20:21:13 <marshmallow> that you really can't learn from a book
20:21:17 <medos> ^
20:21:19 <medos> thank you
20:21:26 * medos can go safely go back to illustrator
20:21:45 <Sat> dont think this has anything to do with books anymore :p
20:21:52 <marshmallow> hokies
20:22:04 * marshmallow goes back to playing on photoshop
20:22:25 <medos> nope
20:22:32 <medos> i am planning to read books about fine arts though
20:22:38 <medos> till i'm a master painter
20:22:42 * medos dissappears
20:22:45 <TheWhisper> medos
20:22:57 <TheWhisper> I am not saying books make you a master
20:23:12 <TheWhisper> I'm saying learning about the history of an art, theories about it, AND practicing it
20:23:16 <TheWhisper> can make you a master
20:23:26 <marshmallow> =/
20:23:29 <marshmallow> i kinda disagree
20:23:40 <marshmallow> I have no idea about most theories of drawing
20:23:45 <marshmallow> and I can draw decently well
20:23:52 <Sat> i'm going to be the best musican in the world, and im not going to listen to any music whilst i try and achieve this endevour!
20:23:55 <marshmallow> nor do I know much about the history
20:24:11 <TheWhisper> We're so sidetracked
20:24:14 <TheWhisper> from the initial discussion
20:24:21 <medos> i'm supposed to read books
20:24:28 <medos> i think i don't need to
20:24:33 <medos> still
20:24:33 <marshmallow> ^^ same
20:24:44 <TheWhisper> But you did at some point
20:24:48 <TheWhisper> So you've proven my point
20:24:58 <marshmallow> i mean, it doesn't hurt...  but if you have limited time..  I would recommend practicing instead.  work smart not hard
20:25:03 <Sat> your supposed to consume new knowledge, and you do it.
20:25:06 <TheWhisper> I was never saying you need to read them your entire life
20:25:12 <TheWhisper> You can, but you don't need to
20:25:16 <TheWhisper> You just need to at some point
20:25:21 <TheWhisper> To get some foundational level
20:25:34 <TheWhisper> so that you're not reinventing concepts that other people have already created
20:25:36 <TheWhisper> and wasting your time
20:25:39 <medos> define your foundation
20:25:42 <medos> define wasting time
20:25:51 <TheWhisper> wasting time = what we're doing now
20:25:58 <Sat> touche
20:26:42 <medos> it's better than you linking random bills and saying how horrible they are without context in a graphic design channel with international crowd and maybe no relation to said matter ;)
20:27:03 <TheWhisper> It's the same ;)
20:28:20 <marshmallow> lawls
20:28:30 <Sat> There is no downside to not learning important concepts & theories. 
20:28:31 <medos> i'm so tempted to just tell you to read a book next time something aint working in .ai :P
20:28:41 <Sat> to learning* woops
20:28:46 <marshmallow> jajaja
20:29:11 <TheWhisper> Medos, me asking you if you know a solution to a problem I have
20:29:16 <TheWhisper> = what I'm talking about
20:29:21 <marshmallow> gar...  people are slow at emailing me assets...  it's been a few hrs and I'm still missing stuff.  *yawn*
20:29:22 <TheWhisper> I could spend 30 minutes fucking around trying to figure it out
20:29:29 <TheWhisper> or 2 minutes getting an answer 
20:30:03 <medos> those 30 minutes couldve taught you 5 other things you didn't know about
20:30:22 <Sat> so could the next 28 which you have gained
20:31:18 <medos> sounds more like work than crafting if there's a direct solution for everything
20:31:50 <TheWhisper> But there's not
20:31:52 <TheWhisper> there are theories
20:31:54 <TheWhisper> and applications
20:31:55 <Sat> you can innovate
20:32:00 <TheWhisper> and this is getting nowhere
20:32:07 <medos> lol
20:32:45 <marshmallow> question...  what's the most useful theory you've learned =D
20:32:52 <marshmallow> from said books
20:33:18 <Sat> doesnt have to be books!
20:33:23 <TheWhisper> I can't say
20:33:31 <TheWhisper> as things are useful in different situations
20:33:38 <marshmallow> well, you guys read way more books than I have
20:33:40 <marshmallow> then top 5
20:33:41 <marshmallow> or top 3
20:33:49 <marshmallow> whichever was your best stuff you learned & use
20:33:52 <TheWhisper> It's not possible for me at least
20:33:59 <TheWhisper> As everything has different value in different situations
20:33:59 <medos> i can do that easily
20:34:07 <TheWhisper> I can just arbitrarily say something is the most useful
20:34:15 <TheWhisper> Just as I can tell you what was my favorite movie 
20:34:15 <marshmallow> ...  seriously?
20:34:17 <TheWhisper> or my favorite book
20:34:22 <TheWhisper> Because I don't have one
20:34:35 <TheWhisper> I can tell you that I really liked X, Y and Z from this book
20:34:44 <TheWhisper> but that this other book had great R, V, and P
20:34:49 <marshmallow> i can tell you what my most interesting/useful book was from my major...
20:34:58 <medos> lol
20:34:58 <Sat> for me what comes to mind is not a thoery, its discovering a style i admire, then practicing that style till i can clain some level of mastery over it. 
20:35:05 <TheWhisper> Anyway I have class
20:35:11 <TheWhisper> (in both senses of the word ;) )
20:35:12 <TheWhisper> jk 
20:35:14 <marshmallow> what kinda style?
20:35:14 <TheWhisper> I have no class
20:35:16 <TheWhisper> but I do have class
20:35:17 <TheWhisper> later
20:35:23 <marshmallow> lawls
20:35:26 <marshmallow> hokies, buh bye
20:35:44 <medos> Sat example :p
20:35:53 <marshmallow> <Sat> for me what comes to mind is not a thoery, its discovering a style i admire, then practicing that style till i can clain some level of mastery over it.  <-- what's the most useful?
20:36:54 <medos> no fair 2 vs 1 now
20:36:55 <medos> haha
20:37:01 <marshmallow> lol
20:37:30 <marshmallow> idk, in general...  the books I read for my major are useless for everyday usage
20:37:33 <marshmallow> except one
20:37:34 <Sat> well its more like inspiration that i am refering to, soo i see a t-shirt design in a book i read, really like it, then copy the shapes in illustrator, combine into new ones and forms and end up with something i really like
20:37:57 <Sat> i discover cel shading
20:38:04 <Sat> start practicing
20:38:15 <Sat> discover machinima, start experimenting
20:38:37 <Sat> learn some fundemetnals about photography, start applying them
20:39:12 <Sat> watch a expert manipulate a single speedlight in a workshop, use it in projects afterwards
20:39:31 <Sat> everything i ever do or did 
20:39:42 <Sat> i copied 
20:39:46 <medos> boo
20:39:47 <Sat> and innovated
20:40:02 <Sat> its how humans learn
20:40:57 <Sat> if you can copy and innovate enough. You might end up inventing. thats very special and very rare
20:42:26 <marshmallow> <Sat> i copied <-- lol.  not copied.  inspired!  XD
20:42:36 <Sat> exactly ;)
20:43:04 <marshmallow> dunno, a lot of that stuff you can find through a simple google search
20:43:13 <marshmallow> which is what I usually do instead of reading books =p
20:43:18 <Sat> every idea you have has come from somewhere, some knowledge you have in your head that has combined with some other knowledge
20:44:09 <Sat> like i said. There is nothing special about books :D (although for me personally there is)
20:44:28 <medos> your examples did mention surprisingly little written knowledge
20:45:49 <marshmallow> yea, that's what I was gonna say too
20:46:16 <medos> FUCK
20:46:25 <marshmallow> WAH?
20:46:31 <medos> activating helvetica
20:46:34 <medos> hurts websites
20:46:36 <Sat> i do print work, so i love seeing all the details in the printed page, the way they use finishes, the layouts. Also the feel and so many other aspects. There is nothing special about gaining knowledge from books as opposed to a kindle or a video
20:46:44 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/0OnZF.png
20:47:10 <Sat> yes i discovered this a while back. arial all the way
20:47:38 <Sat> unless your on a mac i guess
20:48:48 <medos> nope windows
20:49:08 <medos> i just tend to activate helvetica by accident
20:49:18 <medos> it's in my common files folder usually
20:55:06 <medos> Sat what version of illustrator are you running?
20:55:52 <Sat> cs5 but i have cs6 dled
20:57:17 <Sat> i have to put an image next to "enquire" heading on a website. do you think this will do ? 
20:57:18 <Sat> http://i.imgur.com/gZ60E.png
20:58:06 <Sat> the company is selling a online platform for teaching film related thigns
20:58:11 <medos> why not inquire?
20:59:03 <Sat> i dunno i have to ignore everything like that, i cant change anything i just have to add 2 images (this one of them) and then ive finished with this project (thank god)
20:59:55 <medos> i'm wondering about too much stuff as to be able to comment on that image
21:00:16 <Sat> haha
21:00:40 <medos> round buttons top right, box navigation, so much empty space
21:01:14 <Sat> colours that bring sweden or ikea instantly to mind
21:05:17 <medos> image made by you?
21:05:19 <medos> drawn?
21:05:24 <medos> or is that just placement by you?
21:05:48 <Sat> drawn 
21:06:18 <Sat> i have 0 control placement or anything like that
21:06:29 <medos> it looks a bit spooky
21:06:41 <medos> i also don't like how the film-thingiewhatever is #000000
21:06:55 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/b2bL9.png
21:08:02 <Sat> ye i guess nothing else on the website is pure black
21:09:19 <medos> if you have any control over that thing make it fit with the header&text or tune down opacity and give that thing inner glow or something to appear translucently shimmering
21:09:21 <Sat> i kinda like the spooky bit ^^ thought i could get away with it since its cinema, could be anything :P
21:09:45 <medos> the movie-reel-thingamabob i mean
21:10:54 <Sat> ye i thought about that i was being a bit lazy not to implient it
21:10:57 <Sat> cheers
21:12:31 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/g9VHp.png intended ?
21:14:00 <Sat> nope, just careless
21:14:04 <medos> great
21:15:53 <medos> last step: take the layer of that image, add a layer style with color overlay and colorpick either that blue or yellow on their site and set the blend mode of that to color/soft light and something in the 1-10% range maybe?
21:15:54 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/jePyK.png
21:16:03 <medos> to make the pic feel more fitting with the page itself

22:40:40 <medos> .tell Kocho testflight works flawlessly, facebook is unintrusive appstore layout sucks horribly, more options, definitely worth upgrading
22:40:52 <Kocho> got it
22:40:54 <Kocho> last night
22:40:54 <medos> unless you use maps
22:40:55 <medos> oh
22:40:58 <medos> ah
22:41:00 <Kocho> lol
22:41:02 <Kocho> didn't take me long
22:41:17 <Kocho> yeah i dunno, its ok
22:41:28 <Kocho> doesn't seem much different
22:41:48 <Kocho> i didn't mind the maps though
22:41:59 <medos> text is biggah
22:48:34 <Kocho> want to see a logo I'm working on?
22:49:33 <Kocho> you don't get a choice
22:49:35 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/bb2.png
22:55:40 <medos> bin so boxy, binbuddy so round
22:55:55 <medos> left center is my fav
23:00:22 <medos> going by stroke weight
23:00:43 <medos> Kocho is that illustrator? D:
23:00:58 <Kocho> yep
23:01:10 <Kocho> its for packaging
23:01:13 <Kocho> not for the web
23:01:32 <Kocho> i think the actual bin I'll use will be the bottom right one
23:01:55 <Kocho> yeah, i think ill have to round the bin off too
23:02:47 <medos> stroke weight left center one
23:02:51 <medos> bottom right bin
23:02:55 <medos> round dat shit
23:02:57 <medos> binned
23:03:28 <Kocho> I'm not sure if i need an arrow or something
23:03:36 <Kocho> showing that you press the lever
23:03:44 <Kocho> i tried a foot, but i can't draw
23:04:40 <medos> a foot?
23:04:47 <medos> how about a shoe?
23:05:06 <TheWhisper> Okay, I need to model an inorganic object that has a purpose but that doesn't make sense in our world (her words, who knows what that means).
23:05:18 <TheWhisper> Lol really? Like what?
23:05:27 <TheWhisper> Also, what do you guys think of a pogo stick on wheels?
23:06:05 <medos> read a book
23:06:20 <medos> it'll help
23:06:20 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlKL_EpnSp8
23:06:21 <medos> :P
23:06:33 <TheWhisper> Kocho, that logo looks pretty complex
23:06:43 <TheWhisper> I could see it as an icon, but a logo? Not sure how well it works.
23:07:09 <Kocho> it'll be fairly big on the packaging
23:07:16 <Kocho> so I'm happy with it being detailed
23:09:40 <TheWhisper> So they're only going to use your logo on the packaging
23:09:42 <TheWhisper> at 1 size?
23:09:50 <TheWhisper> Why do they even want a logo then lol
23:09:51 <Kocho> yep
23:10:00 <Kocho> its a pretty quick job
23:10:04 <TheWhisper> Doesn't seem very future-proof
23:10:09 <TheWhisper> But hey, if that's all they want, whatever
23:10:11 <Kocho> its not
23:10:17 <Kocho> thats not my problem really
23:10:48 <TheWhisper> Oh
23:10:51 <TheWhisper> I see
23:10:57 <TheWhisper> It's a little lever system
23:11:00 <TheWhisper> that attaches to your bin
23:11:05 <Kocho> yeah
23:11:08 <TheWhisper> So you don't need to touch it
23:11:13 <TheWhisper> Lol
23:11:14 <Kocho> yep
23:11:14 <Kocho> lol
23:11:17 <TheWhisper> This is like an illustration
23:11:20 <TheWhisper> haha
23:11:23 <Kocho> yeah
23:11:31 <Kocho> well what they have now is an illustration
23:11:34 <TheWhisper> May as well just combine product art + manual + logo into one thing
