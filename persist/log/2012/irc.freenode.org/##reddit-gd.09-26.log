04:32:19 <TheWhisper> *it is now
04:32:35 <TheWhisper> Also, it's way too small to give you a real good crit

04:33:11 <R0tt3n> yeah i didnt come up with the copy ahha
04:33:22 <R0tt3n> origionaly it was suppose to be "Dance, Play, Fuck"
04:33:25 <TheWhisper> lol
04:33:26 <TheWhisper> really?
04:33:30 <R0tt3n> originally* 
04:33:32 <R0tt3n> yeah lol
04:33:35 <TheWhisper> what
04:33:37 <TheWhisper> what is this place
04:33:41 <TheWhisper> a burlesque? lol
04:33:56 <R0tt3n> lol no
04:33:58 <R0tt3n> just a club
04:34:02 <TheWhisper> ah
04:34:03 <TheWhisper> strip club
04:34:05 <TheWhisper> so
04:34:08 <R0tt3n> nah lol
04:34:20 <R0tt3n> just a club, but upstairs is like a swingers club
04:34:20 <zakmac> http://imgur.com/CHxMN $0.02 and I'm still not a fan, TheWhisper  is right about the bottom logos
04:34:54 <TheWhisper> ^ better
04:35:02 <TheWhisper> though the 'play' on top doesn't stand out enough
04:35:06 <zakmac> I count three fonts by your design alone and another 4 by the included logos
04:35:12 <zakmac> No, no it does not
04:35:17 <R0tt3n> not a fan of the design?
04:35:59 <zakmac> Not really, and it reads like an event called "thursdays at play" You need to break it up visually to read "only thursdays, at play"
04:37:02 <zakmac> http://imgur.com/sCx5r
04:37:05 <zakmac> Aw yeeh
04:37:31 <R0tt3n> so should i limit my fonts?

04:38:42 <TheWhisper> Hm
04:38:47 <zakmac> Definitely. And you want to be sure your fonts either match or completely do not. You'll get an oddball "something went wrong look" if they're just kinda close
04:39:18 <TheWhisper> R0tt3n, is this place going for like a 1920s swinger type atmosphere?
04:40:05 <R0tt3n> no its like: Young Professionals, Artsy, Trendy, Singles, Twenties, Thirties
04:40:14 <TheWhisper> hm
04:40:24 <TheWhisper> Are there other examples of their stuff?

04:41:59 <TheWhisper> Is prostitution legal in canada?
04:42:41 <R0tt3n> no
04:42:48 <TheWhisper> yes
04:42:54 <TheWhisper> "In Canada, the buying and selling of sexual services are legal"
04:42:54 <R0tt3n> well
04:42:56 <TheWhisper> lol
04:42:58 <R0tt3n> we have brothels
04:43:07 <TheWhisper> "ublic communication for the purpose of prostitution, brothels and procuring are offences under the criminal law"
04:43:13 <TheWhisper> so it is legal
04:43:17 <R0tt3n> its not legal in the sense of pimps and streetwalkers
04:43:20 <TheWhisper> but getting to it and finding out about it = not so much
04:43:30 <R0tt3n> eyeha
04:43:52 <R0tt3n> anyways fuck man, that one you posted from that forum is so much better than mine
04:43:58 <TheWhisper> erally?

04:45:12 <TheWhisper> is what it seems like to me
04:45:15 <TheWhisper> no
04:45:18 <TheWhisper> zakmac
04:45:20 <TheWhisper> I think it's good
04:45:23 <TheWhisper> and it has potential
04:45:27 <TheWhisper> but you need to say
04:45:32 <TheWhisper> 1) what is the theme you're going for
04:45:37 <TheWhisper> 2) is it the right theme for the audience?
04:45:47 <TheWhisper> 3) what are other examples of that theme?
04:46:13 <TheWhisper> I was getting a retro vibe
04:46:31 <TheWhisper> With some art deco in there
04:46:33 <TheWhisper> because that's a sort of art deco style typeface
04:46:57 <TheWhisper> http://mickeyavenue.com/fonts/images/Kem-Weber-sample.png

04:47:01 <R0tt3n> yeah i wanted to go for the art deco style cause the crowd seems to be that artsy trendy type

12:56:24 <medos> considering that they still have to pick the typeface
12:56:31 <medos> i think i'm safe with a few rough edges
12:56:34 <medos> this being one of two
12:57:57 <medos> you're right though, stuff like that would would/will/might get fixed

13:56:43 <marshmallow> oh
13:56:45 <marshmallow> idk
13:56:45 <internetpolice> i never wanted to buy any
13:57:08 <internetpolice> now there's someone else who does it
13:57:24 <internetpolice> so less likely to earn money on it
13:57:40 * marshmallow shrugs
13:57:58 <marshmallow> sorry?
13:58:07 <internetpolice> no, don't worry about it :P
13:58:19 <internetpolice> i just linked you to it to show you that there was actual interest in it
13:58:29 <marshmallow> oh.  lol
14:00:47 <internetpolice> tl;dr: i said "draw some hands! i'll vectorize them and make a mini site to sell them on so we earn money!" three months ago
14:00:55 <internetpolice> now someone else did it
14:01:22 <internetpolice> better than being half-done with it though
14:01:31 <internetpolice> while the dribbble guy released his hand set now
14:01:57 <marshmallow> >_<;
14:02:29 <marshmallow> idk, i have higher priorities on my mind then making money =/

14:03:19 <marshmallow> lol, not the top priority
14:03:27 <marshmallow> but it would be nice to get one XD
14:03:44 <internetpolice> draw some gesture hands
14:03:49 <internetpolice> i'll vectorize them and make a site
14:03:53 <internetpolice> and we give them away for free
14:04:06 <internetpolice> that'll give you exposure and people might invite you to dribbble :P
14:04:17 <marshmallow> lol
14:04:35 <internetpolice> bad idea too? :|
14:04:46 <marshmallow> idk
14:05:40 <marshmallow> fine, I'll draw something else for ya to vectorize
14:05:45 <internetpolice> hahaha
14:05:48 <marshmallow> what do you like...  besides hands
14:06:02 <internetpolice> i kinda expected to get a middle finger gesture hand now
14:06:12 <marshmallow> =D
14:06:38 <internetpolice> hm
14:07:00 <internetpolice> i need to think of something first
14:07:08 <marshmallow> lol
14:07:25 <marshmallow> I can draw anything except specific people.

14:09:07 <marshmallow> =.=
14:09:13 <marshmallow> I'm not doing your app for you!
14:09:21 <marshmallow> or video
14:09:29 <medos> then i ruined it
14:09:46 <medos> because now you would think that every request i make is for my own personal profit
14:10:29 <marshmallow> =p
14:10:39 <medos> draw a squid with tentacles that are flowers
14:10:41 <medos> thank you

14:13:16 <medos> something like that
14:13:24 <medos> it's the first random thing that came to mind
14:14:01 <marshmallow> errr, hokay
14:14:51 <marshmallow> i'll bring mai ipad tomorrow and draw
14:15:46 <medos> awesome
14:15:59 <medos> i might have a better idea in the meantime
14:16:22 <medos> but i guess it'll be a flowtacle-squid
14:19:10 <marshmallow> =/
14:19:32 <marshmallow> hmr.. I should've bout my ipad today
14:19:39 <marshmallow> gonna be a slow day
14:19:43 <marshmallow> everyone is jewish apparently
14:20:33 <medos> http://projects.stroep.nl/findClosest/
14:20:34 <marshmallow> *should've brought
14:21:35 <marshmallow> drawing with a mouse is wayyyy harder
14:22:00 <medos> that's all i do D:
14:22:56 <marshmallow> yea but it's slower =/
14:23:26 <marshmallow> i did that with the camera app thing I showed you
14:23:31 <marshmallow> (as in draw with the mouse)
14:23:40 <marshmallow> i messed up quite often / wasted time
14:24:07 <medos> wasn't that more constructed than drawn?
14:24:45 <marshmallow> define constructed?
14:27:05 <medos> a circle was made with the circle tool and you adjusted the circle
14:27:17 <medos> rather than trying to doodle a circle 20 times
14:27:44 <marshmallow> oh
14:27:50 <marshmallow> hokay then
14:27:57 <marshmallow> though the rest was mostly pen tool
14:28:01 <medos> yeah
14:29:23 <medos> i wasn't saying that constructing is a bad thing
14:29:34 <medos> it's just my term for precise mousedrawing
14:29:36 <medos> i guess
14:30:38 * marshmallow shrugs
14:30:47 <marshmallow> what i need is a wacom =D
14:30:49 <marshmallow> waccom?
14:30:52 <marshmallow> idk how it's spelled
14:30:53 <marshmallow> lol
14:33:29 <Sat> wacom was correct, i have one, and yes tis awesome
14:34:33 <Sat> i need to practice drawing way more though
14:35:09 <Sat> last thing i doodled http://i.imgur.com/gkOZE.jpg
14:36:52 <medos> not bad
14:38:05 <marshmallow> pretty good

14:41:14 <Sat> kk it is, ye thats pretty awesome
14:42:07 <marshmallow> yea, I drew it on my ipad
14:42:08 <Sat> i was really impressed by whats possible on the ipad, i never considered how well you could draw on it
14:42:11 <Sat> http://www.minimallyminimal.com/?page=3&category=sketches
14:43:30 <marshmallow> http://imgur.com/hCkMt <-- I drew this on an iPad
14:44:41 <marshmallow> hmr.. letme find another drawing...
14:45:01 <Sat> very nice
14:45:15 <Sat> drawing hands is hard
14:45:47 <marshmallow> meh, i've been drawing on-and-off for years
14:46:14 <medos> MEH
14:47:33 <Sat> being able to draw well is such an asset
14:48:47 <marshmallow> i can draw decently any object
14:48:53 <marshmallow> and people
14:49:03 <marshmallow> but if you told me to draw a SPECIFIC person, no.. I can't
14:49:11 <marshmallow> i'm missing that spark-so-to-speak
14:49:29 <marshmallow> like, If I drew myself, it'll look like a person, but it won't look specifically like me
14:50:11 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/fV0M7.gif
14:50:18 <Sat> the people i envy the most are the people who can draw their ideas so vividly. 
14:51:01 <marshmallow> drawing takes practice
14:51:20 <marshmallow> i've taken years and years of fine-arts classes
14:51:41 <medos> whatcha think about my latest drawing? :P
14:51:52 <marshmallow> <medos> http://i.imgur.com/fV0M7.gif <-- this?

18:20:34 <medos> hm
18:20:51 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/3n2H1.png
18:22:41 <Sat> i wouldnt go with clean serifs
18:22:56 <Sat> want to tweak them a bit
18:23:18 <Sat> or is part of it to keep the type as it is?
18:25:49 <medos> i did that yesterday
18:26:36 <medos> tweaking would not be done to the actual wordmark though
18:26:53 <medos> at most rip it apart once for presentation/highres material
18:29:22 <Sat> i see, well it's hard to use a type like that and have some sort of fantasy vibe i think
18:30:16 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/TAy9q.png
18:31:26 <Sat> have you been commisoned to design their logo?
18:31:59 <medos> kinda
18:32:37 <medos> the bare simple wordmark would probably make more sense to you if you knew that they might expand beyond wow/LoL
18:32:52 <medos> so for that case they would prefer something simple, either serif or sans serif
18:32:54 <medos> hence two choices
18:34:20 <Sat> Cool, thats a fun piece of work

18:37:14 <Sat> the nihilum one is pretty good
18:37:19 <Sat> sans

18:40:17 <medos> not in those folders = not relevant
18:40:18 <medos> :P
18:41:00 <Sat> are you going to add a mark?
18:42:21 <medos> http://i.minus.com/ibaeJIPnmpiQy1.jpg < :OOOOOOOOOO
18:42:24 <medos> sorry just saw that
18:42:57 <medos> http://i.minus.com/i9ULQeaLtx7L9.png
18:42:59 <medos> ^
18:43:13 <Sat> isn't that nice he's doing a backflip
18:44:00 <medos> i just like well executed expressive sketched figures
18:45:42 <medos> whoa
18:45:59 <medos> didn't know chrome to mobile is a feature of chrome now?
18:46:04 <medos> or did i fuck some settings up
18:48:16 <Sat> Accension, hmm what about having the cross bars accend?
18:48:52 <medos> that's all old stuff and i'm working on something entirely different
18:49:11 <medos> if the guy wouldn't have just opened my wip files while streaming on twitch tv i wouldn't even post images here
18:49:19 <medos> lele
18:49:52 <Sat> eh your not working on that now?
18:50:04 <medos> nope
18:50:14 <Sat> troll
18:50:21 <medos> why?
18:50:26 <medos> you asked if i add a wordmark
18:50:46 <medos> i posted a pic of first attempts to make one
18:51:37 <medos> *symbol/mark
18:51:38 <medos> i mean
18:53:19 <Sat> cause of the questions you were asking and the fact you posted that wordmark quite a few times today. and you mentioned something about showing it to the client
18:55:32 <medos> i asked for a good sans-serif text effect that conveys world of warcraft/gaming
18:57:06 <medos> then i said glowing red
18:57:36 <medos> :P
18:58:27 <Sat> you were posting itterations of the design earlier!
18:59:03 <medos> i was indeed
18:59:24 <medos> i usually do that to lure TheWhisper into spending hours on critiquing them
18:59:37 <medos> he didn't bite today :(
19:01:17 <medos> i would need to send you the brief to partake in logo-style and look brainstorming
19:02:50 <marshmallow> ?challenge
19:05:16 <Sat> you started that?
19:05:29 <marshmallow> oh, I was just reading it
19:05:35 <marshmallow> dunno if i'll do it
19:05:47 <Sat> ah k
19:05:47 <marshmallow> right now I'm just got PSY on my mind
19:06:07 <Sat> i PSY'd myself out
19:06:14 <marshmallow> so, I see PSY with a giant burger going "HEYYYYYYYYyyyyyy..  Sexy laddyyyyy"
19:06:17 <marshmallow> XD
19:06:20 <marshmallow> that's all i got
19:06:39 * marshmallow is listening to gangnam style.
19:07:07 <Sat> there should be a girl stuffing her face with a massive burger, then you could have PSY staring at her giant "sexy" ass
19:14:00 <marshmallow> lol
19:16:47 <Sat> http://i.imgur.com/akfR4.jpg was curious if it would work
19:17:20 <marshmallow> looks a little carried away
19:17:22 <Sat> had potential i think
19:18:10 <medos> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/12-07/awwwwyea.png
19:18:23 <medos> lol
19:20:09 <Sat> gg
19:20:50 <medos> looks a little hm
19:20:54 <medos> off
19:22:21 <TheWhisper> <medos> he didn't bite today :(
19:22:23 <marshmallow> yay fridge pal!
19:22:26 <TheWhisper> maybe if you actually ask then I will
19:22:29 <marshmallow> but um, not on droid
19:22:34 <marshmallow> so, no me gusta =p
19:22:40 <TheWhisper> instead of expecting me to read your mind :)
19:22:45 <medos> no
19:22:49 <medos> that was kind of the purpose
19:22:55 <medos> because you tend to critique for half an hour
19:22:58 <medos> then i go "got it"
19:23:01 <medos> then you go awesome
19:23:08 <medos> while i already knew i need to fix it
19:23:11 <TheWhisper> <Sat> http://i.imgur.com/akfR4.jpg was curious if it would work <- Activision lol
19:23:34 <TheWhisper> <medos> while i already knew i need to fix it
19:23:36 <TheWhisper> mean
19:23:57 <medos> not mean
19:25:22 <TheWhisper> mean
19:25:46 <medos> you tend to critique anyway
19:25:48 <medos> ;)
19:25:51 <medos> just wait for tomorrow
19:25:54 <medos> i post pic
19:26:06 <medos> you go fancy
19:26:11 <TheWhisper> I don't wanna critique if it's not at a critiquing stage tho
19:26:54 <TheWhisper> "Texas mom complains after male teacher paddles daughter; school board responds with policy allowing teachers of either gender to paddle students." Lol, this is a lovely display of passive aggressiveness
19:27:10 <marshmallow> lol
19:28:24 <medos> that's fucking awesome
19:28:35 <TheWhisper> "Just to be clear, the girl chose to be paddled over in-school suspension. The mother was contacted BEFORE the paddling, and gave the school permission to paddle her daughter. "
19:28:37 <TheWhisper> lol
19:28:56 <TheWhisper> "Furthermore, the school already had rules in place stating that the student, as a female, could only be spanked by a female administrator. She was spanked by a male who was unaware of this particular rule.
19:28:56 <TheWhisper> The complaints have nothing to do with a "creepiness" factor that you might expect. Instead, the complaint is that a female administrator should have been used because a male hits too hard, and because that's the rules."
19:29:02 <TheWhisper> this is just hilariously awesome
19:29:36 <medos> math teacher of mine threw one of my classmates (female) in the trashcan
19:29:49 <TheWhisper> "Watt said her 16-year-old daughter, Jada, deserved to be spanked after she spoke sarcastically to a teacher and an assistant principal, but she did not deserve to be bruised. And what kind of message does it send these boys? [...] Is it telling them that its OK to hit a girl?"
19:29:50 <TheWhisper> lol
19:29:55 <TheWhisper> this entire situation sounds so dumb
19:30:14 <medos> e.g.: went to her seat, lifted her up and placed her in the (empty) huge bin we had in our classroom
19:31:11 <TheWhisper> ^ that's terrible and hilarious too
19:32:01 <medos> considering that students got beat up by teachers regularly in the past
19:32:08 <medos> it's a huge improvement
19:32:08 <medos> :p
19:32:10 <Sat> my english teacher broke his rib by reading shakespeare too passionately
19:32:34 <Sat> hit himself in the chest emphasising some point

21:10:19 <throatvibration> Hey, so I mentioned earlier that I have to design a type specimen for a specific typeface.
21:10:41 <throatvibration> What I didn't mention is that it needs to be a digital specimen, that can be viewed on like tablets n shizz
21:11:00 <throatvibration> Anyway, I had a cool idea and what to get some opinions on it.
21:11:28 <throatvibration> It's not flesh out at all; this is just a rough concept for it
21:11:31 <throatvibration> But you go to a page
21:11:35 <throatvibration> and it's just filled with a color
21:11:40 <throatvibration> like red or blue or something
21:11:54 <throatvibration> and then the keyboard pops up
21:12:04 <throatvibration> or the letters are arrayed on the side of the screen or something
21:12:06 <throatvibration> and you hit one
21:12:14 <throatvibration> and wedges fly in from the side
21:12:16 <throatvibration> *sides
21:12:18 <throatvibration> to form the letter
21:12:27 <throatvibration> using negative space
21:13:04 <throatvibration> thearrowflies zakmac carson edsgd marshmallow medos 
21:13:06 <throatvibration> sat edodes
21:13:31 <throatvibration> *fleshed out
21:13:48 <throatvibration> And this also won't be the entire specimen - it'll just be one part of it
21:14:01 <thearrowflies> i cant help you
21:14:09 <thearrowflies> i barely open photoshop
21:14:10 <throatvibration> Why not?
21:14:16 <throatvibration> You still use tablets though
21:14:21 <thearrowflies> i dont
21:14:24 <throatvibration> Oh
21:14:26 <throatvibration> Me either lolol
21:14:27 <thearrowflies> if i could aford one
21:14:37 <throatvibration> Well, anyway, what do you think of the idea as a user?
21:15:17 <thearrowflies> if you can make it look good
21:15:19 <thearrowflies> do it
21:17:46 <marshmallow> ?
21:17:53 <throatvibration> look up ^
21:18:06 <medos> tl;dr?
21:18:15 <throatvibration> :(
21:18:19 <throatvibration> ipad type specimen book
21:18:23 <throatvibration> concept idea:
21:18:32 <throatvibration> solid color page
21:18:38 <throatvibration> with keyboard popup or letters on it somewhere
21:18:41 <throatvibration> click a letter
21:18:54 <throatvibration> wedges/parts in a different color fly in from the edges
21:19:07 <throatvibration> to form the letter
21:19:43 <throatvibration> tl;dr
21:19:43 <marshmallow> what's the point?
21:19:43 <marshmallow> to see cool colors fly?
21:19:43 <throatvibration> type specimen
21:19:43 <throatvibration> to show you
21:19:43 <throatvibration> what letters 
21:19:43 <throatvibration> look like
21:19:43 <throatvibration> which is the point of the specimen
21:19:43 <throatvibration> lolol
21:20:08 <marshmallow> what do you mean "show you what letters look like"
21:20:14 <throatvibration> how they're formed
21:20:20 <throatvibration> and what each letter in the typeface looks like
21:20:31 <marshmallow> oooh
21:20:57 <marshmallow> idk, i'm not a big typographic nut like certain people...
21:21:38 <marshmallow> so, I honestly dunno if I would use it
21:21:50 <marshmallow> to be fair, I hardly use any apps on my iPad though
21:22:17 <marshmallow> besides the drawing, occasional notes, & ebooks..  I haven't found a use for my ipad >_<;;
21:22:33 <marshmallow> good thing it was free -.-;;;
21:24:15 <throatvibration> lol
21:24:33 <throatvibration> Marshmallow, you know what type specimens are right?
21:24:33 <Sat> i like the sound of it. hope that helps :p
21:24:42 <marshmallow> nope
21:24:45 <marshmallow> =p
21:24:48 <Sat> :D
21:24:53 <throatvibration> oh lol
21:25:02 <Sat> im picturing black and white not colour
21:25:03 <throatvibration> It's not really something you "use" per se
21:25:18 <throatvibration> It's more a reference
21:25:24 <throatvibration> and a thing that gives you an idea about fonts before you buy 
21:26:15 <marshmallow> oh
21:26:30 <marshmallow> then i definitely wouldn't use it.  I don't really get a choice in what fonts are bought

21:40:07 <medos> same
21:40:35 <medos> zakmac let's go look for that door that leads to Whisper's head
21:40:36 <throatvibrations> because
21:40:36 <throatvibrations> ideas
21:40:39 <medos> then we film it
21:40:44 <throatvibrations> I just told you the idea
21:40:46 <throatvibrations> that's like saying
21:40:52 <medos> and call it "Being The Whispervic"
21:40:57 <throatvibrations> "how can you critique a story in a book? it's just word

21:43:36 <throatvibrations> "it's a good idea but it doesn't have something it needs"
21:43:41 <throatvibrations> "but I won't tell you what it needs"

22:05:58 <throatvibrations> Medos, what do you mean 'really'?
22:05:59 <throatvibrations> Yes, really
22:06:12 <throatvibrations> I'm stuck using one of the shitty mac mice
22:06:14 <throatvibrations> that suck
22:06:41 <medos> ?dwi

22:13:08 <throatvibrations> I love having a big monitor
22:13:18 <throatvibrations> time to search for monitors on newegg
22:13:21 <throatvibrations> any recommendations?
22:13:56 <medos> sony
22:14:09 <throatvibrations> hm
22:14:17 <throatvibrations> What about type of screen?
22:14:18 <throatvibrations> LCD?
22:14:19 <medos> your video is irrelevant to edwards problem
22:14:33 <medos> because edward most probably was deleting mails from his iphone
22:14:46 <medos> which does not "archive" with a microsoft account
22:14:49 <medos> but "delete"
22:14:53 <medos> "archive" is gmail
22:15:28 <throatvibrations> Ah
22:15:30 <throatvibrations> I see
22:15:47 <throatvibrations> Also, IPS LCD is better than TN  right?
22:18:37 <medos> sony
22:19:12 <throatvibrations> ...
22:19:37 <throatvibrations> lol
22:19:41 <throatvibrations> newegg only has one sony monitor?
22:19:42 <throatvibrations> what
22:19:50 <medos> damn
22:19:52 <medos> why?
22:20:30 <throatvibrations> I dunno
22:20:43 <throatvibrations> Well
22:20:49 <throatvibrations> Only one LCD monitor for sony
22:20:54 <throatvibrations> they have 4 Large Format ones
22:21:13 <throatvibrations> but those are all 1k dolans +
22:21:50 <throatvibrations> medos you do realize all these sony monitors are $1,000+ right?
22:21:55 <throatvibrations> I'm looking at their site
22:21:59 <throatvibrations> and there's only one that's less
22:22:02 <throatvibrations> and it's $949
22:22:03 <throatvibrations> lol

22:23:09 <medos> remember that time when you asked for a monitor recommendation?
22:23:55 <throatvibrations> yes
22:24:10 <throatvibrations> Let me phrase it better
22:24:19 <throatvibrations> What's a good, reasonably priced and affordable monitor?
