03:58:04 <marshmallow> nah, i'm gonna sleep soon
03:58:17 <ElliotSH> Hello everyone, I was wondering if I could get your critiques of a logo I made. It's not allowed in the reddit, so is it okay to ask in here?
03:58:42 <TheWhisper> hy is it not allowed?
03:58:44 <TheWhisper> *Why
03:58:44 <marshmallow> hokies
03:58:52 <marshmallow> i think it's allowed in /r/design
03:58:53 <TheWhisper> Oh
03:58:55 <TheWhisper> Nah
03:58:58 <TheWhisper> design_critiques
03:59:01 <marshmallow> but not in /r/graphic_design
03:59:18 <TheWhisper> www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques is a good place, but we'd be glad to check it out in here too.
03:59:20 <marshmallow> well, /r/design_critique doesn't get the type of traffic that /r/design gets
03:59:27 <TheWhisper> Yeah, but /r/design sucks
03:59:33 * marshmallow shrugs
03:59:48 <ElliotSH> *chuckles*
03:59:50 <marshmallow> i prefer more eyeballs
04:00:02 <marshmallow> but yar, let's see
04:00:05 <TheWhisper> I prefer better eyeballs
04:00:22 <marshmallow> lol
04:00:36 <ElliotSH> Anyways, I'm creating a cleaning company, and have limited funds. So, I decided to try my hand at designing a logo. This is merely a prototype (if you guys like it, I will vector the graphic), but I thought I would see what the consensus was:
04:00:37 <ElliotSH> http://i.imgur.com/2eMAU.jpg?1
04:01:09 <marshmallow> lawls.  clean/kleen
04:01:23 <ElliotSH> I'm not a clever man :P
04:01:24 <TheWhisper> hm
04:01:34 <TheWhisper> Sort of intense and imposing
04:01:43 <TheWhisper> Very authoritative, and not so friendly
04:01:45 <ElliotSH> On a side note, is the "LLC" obnoxious? Not sure if it makes it too cluttered.
04:01:47 <marshmallow> i heard lines were bad for logos, they get lost when you shrink it
04:01:48 <EDSGD> hey do you know of of people who do social issues
04:01:49 <EDSGD> .
04:02:04 <marshmallow> define "social issues"
04:02:18 <ElliotSH> What makes it imposing? The font?
04:02:35 <TheWhisper> That, and the bold and straight underline/handle
04:02:48 <TheWhisper> also, the place where the handle connects to the head of the broom is not right
04:03:02 <marshmallow> true
04:03:15 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/ZTwSr.png I think it should be more like that
04:03:24 <TheWhisper> -ish :P
04:03:27 <TheWhisper> somewhere around there
04:03:38 <ElliotSH> Yeah, it was mostly a prototype I suppose. Once I vector it, it will be more aligned I think. Thanks for the feedback, though.
04:03:52 <TheWhisper> hm
04:03:53 <ElliotSH> Well, the reason I chose that font was it was the only decent "all caps" font I know of
04:03:56 <TheWhisper> What kind of cleaning company?
04:04:06 <ElliotSH> When I tried to go with an upper/lower case font, the p caused issues with the handle.
04:04:14 <ElliotSH> Commercial cleaning, such as offices and gyms.
04:04:50 <TheWhisper> hm
04:05:07 <TheWhisper> If it's commercial, then maybe it doesn't need to be super friendly
04:05:13 <TheWhisper> It's Knockout, right?
04:05:38 <TheWhisper> (the typeface, i mean)
04:06:33 <ElliotSH> It's Bebas Neue.
04:06:53 <TheWhisper> Darn :(
04:07:05 <TheWhisper> (darn at my inability to identify it, i mean)
04:07:07 <ElliotSH> Although, don't worry, I like that one too ^_^, they are quite similar
04:07:12 <TheWhisper> Yeah
04:07:30 <ElliotSH> And if it was a maid service, I would agree that it's imposing, but my intuition is that office complexes would value reliability over cheerfullness....if that makes sense
04:07:34 <TheWhisper> Yeah
04:07:37 <ElliotSH> Although, then again, I'm not a graphics designer :)
04:07:49 <ElliotSH> Err, Graphic Designer?
04:08:08 <TheWhisper> I think that it's not an outstanding logo
04:08:12 <TheWhisper> but it's not a terrible one
04:08:21 <TheWhisper> It's sort of just "oh hey that's a logo, that's nice"
04:08:37 <TheWhisper> I've definitely seen worse though
04:08:43 <TheWhisper> cough arby's redesigned logo cough
04:09:09 <ElliotSH> *chuckles* Honestly, judging by the typical "small business" logos, it's not a competitive field in terms of design :P
04:09:22 <TheWhisper> Got some examples?
04:09:41 <ElliotSH> See, I'm afraid if I went with something too "edgy", like Apple's logo, it won't really work since obvious there's not much name recognition.
04:09:44 <ElliotSH> Sure, one sec.
04:10:24 <ElliotSH> http://www.capitalcitycleaners.org/bg-1.gif?u=634207100790585000
04:10:36 <TheWhisper> lol apple being edgy
04:10:39 <TheWhisper> wow
04:10:40 <TheWhisper> well
04:10:42 <TheWhisper> um
04:10:43 <ElliotSH> Mostly, the trend here is just slap a letterhead + clip art
04:10:50 <TheWhisper> wow
04:11:03 <TheWhisper> Aren't you afraid of being swept away?
04:11:10 <ElliotSH> You ass :P
04:11:33 <TheWhisper> Yeah, you've got them beat by a mile lol
04:11:39 <ElliotSH> Perhaps edgy is the wrong word though, perhaps "cute"? I figure I should go with something minimalistic since I don't want to confuse people.
04:11:50 <ElliotSH> But if you have a suggestion for something more creative, I would love to hear it :)
04:12:04 <TheWhisper> Only if you pay ;)
04:12:07 <TheWhisper> lol
04:12:09 <TheWhisper> Just kidding
04:12:14 <TheWhisper> No ideas though
04:12:21 <ElliotSH> Alright, fair enough. 
04:12:33 <ElliotSH> Would you reccomend the knockout typeface over my current one?
04:12:33 <TheWhisper> I bet edsgd has tons of ideas. He always talks about wanting to brand a cleaning business
04:12:36 <TheWhisper> Uh
04:13:00 <TheWhisper> I don't think it would change that much in terms of the overall feel of the logo
04:13:05 <ElliotSH> Oh, I didn't realize how close it was.
04:13:09 <TheWhisper> Yeah
04:13:11 <ElliotSH> (Yeah, just googled it)
04:13:23 <ElliotSH> Out of curiosity, do you think one is a "knock off" of the other?
04:13:30 <TheWhisper> Nope
04:13:39 <ElliotSH> Not sure if typeface-makers somehow get a monetary incentive, or something.
04:14:14 <marshmallow> I think your logo is fine.  Not super ZOMG, but it will get the job done
04:14:18 <TheWhisper> They're just similar sans-serif faces
04:15:12 <ElliotSH> Alright, thanks for the feedback. I temporarily fixed the broom & will tweak it when I vector it. Does this "edsgd" character frequent this room?
04:15:27 <TheWhisper> haha 
04:15:29 <TheWhisper> he's in here now
04:15:30 <TheWhisper> and yes
04:15:33 <TheWhisper> but I was just kidding
04:15:42 <TheWhisper> Trying to get his goat, so to speak
04:15:42 <ElliotSH> Oh, I'm a derp. Somehow the all caps made me not notice him
04:15:57 <TheWhisper> :P
04:16:04 <ElliotSH> I don't get the humor. Was he recently screwed over by a cleaning company or smth?
04:16:24 <TheWhisper> Nah, just teasing him for no reason
04:17:32 <ElliotSH> How sweet. One last question, do you think the "LLC" in the bottom right clutters it? I'm not really sure if it adds balance, or is just obnoxious.
04:17:41 <EDSGD> I know how to brand a cleaning business
04:17:41 <ElliotSH> (if you already closed the link: http://i.imgur.com/2eMAU.jpg?1 )
04:17:46 <EDSGD> give ne a sex
04:17:48 <EDSGD> *sec
04:17:52 <ElliotSH> mmkay
04:17:58 <EDSGD> I'll give you a quick mockup
04:18:21 <TheWhisper> lol
04:18:25 <ElliotSH> If it's goatse or something, I will be quite disappointed in you, sir.
04:18:36 <TheWhisper> I think the LLC gets lost when you zoom out to a small size
04:18:53 <TheWhisper> Which, depending on how you're planning to use the logo (letterheads, biz cards, etc) could be a problem
04:19:14 <ElliotSH> I kind of agree. Especially since the logo is for business cards & embroidery on shirts, I think it might get lost. I'll cull it, thanks.
04:19:16 <TheWhisper> I do think it acts as a nice balance though
04:19:40 <TheWhisper> Without it, it seems a little broom-head heavy
04:20:46 <ElliotSH> Mmm, yeah. That's what I was worrying about. But I'm not sure if it will be at all legible in small print. I might leave it for the cards, but pull it for the shirts I think.
04:21:34 <TheWhisper> Shirts as in uniforms?
04:21:51 <ElliotSH> I suppose you could call them that. But it's not really that formal.
04:22:21 <TheWhisper> ah
04:22:22 <ElliotSH> Basically just a way to not look like a random guy wandering around cleaning a building (plus recognition, etc.)
04:23:05 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/amlDX.png - feelsgoodbro.png
04:23:21 <TheWhisper> lol
04:23:28 <TheWhisper> I thought you ditched that job
04:23:38 <ElliotSH> Wow. That's really good.
04:24:00 <zakmac> Kissed and made up
04:24:08 <TheWhisper> Zakmac, the button overbalances the right side
04:24:14 <EDSGD> I'm uploading it now.
04:24:16 <TheWhisper> pretty sick otherwise
04:24:21 <EDSGD> This will get you much attention
04:24:26 <EDSGD> So avante garde 
04:24:30 <TheWhisper> oh god
04:24:35 <ElliotSH> Oh lordy
04:24:38 <ElliotSH> Brace yourselves
04:24:49 <EDSGD> http://imgur.com/lfXqU
04:24:51 <ElliotSH> zak, I'm not a designer by any means
04:24:57 <EDSGD> still needs some massaging
04:25:01 <zakmac> TheWhisper: point is to draw attention to the right as the main action is sign in. The "or" is off though
04:25:02 <ElliotSH> But if I may offser some advice, why not stack it vertically?
04:25:04 <EDSGD> but I think I have somethingunique
04:25:14 <ElliotSH> e.g. put the sign in button inside of the wooden area
04:25:18 <TheWhisper> yeah, but it just doesn't seem centered properly
04:25:32 <ElliotSH> and the or/create account on the bottom of the wooden box
04:25:41 <zakmac> Nah I wouldn
04:25:55 <zakmac> 't toss it in the wood, but I might attach something under the wood and chuck it in there
04:25:56 <TheWhisper> Also, if anything, wouldn't you want to weight down the create an account side?
04:26:04 <ElliotSH> *shrugs* fair enough.
04:26:08 <TheWhisper> If I have an account, you don't need to incentivize me to log in
04:26:08 <zakmac> No, the sites already got a solid user base
04:26:09 <ElliotSH> EDSGD: Bob's?
04:26:12 <TheWhisper> okay
04:26:13 <TheWhisper> so
04:26:17 <TheWhisper> eh
04:26:25 <zakmac> Main user base is 50+
04:26:25 <TheWhisper> lol
04:26:29 <zakmac> Big easy targets
04:26:32 <TheWhisper> edsgd so edgey
04:26:33 <zakmac> Fitt's law and all that
04:26:45 <TheWhisper> elliotsh, he essentially made you a trendy hipster logo
04:27:05 <zakmac> EDSGD: I like where its headed, maybe rework/lose the apostrophe
04:27:15 <TheWhisper> lol zak
04:27:32 <TheWhisper> Ohhhh you meant /age/ 50+
04:27:39 <TheWhisper> I was like 'only 50 users? lame'
04:27:46 <zakmac> Your face is lame
04:27:47 <EDSGD> Thanks guise.
04:27:52 <zakmac> I see
04:27:52 <ElliotSH> Oh, I thought he was trying to troll me with the unaligned brooms/ uncentered typface & the random "BOB's". 
04:27:56 <EDSGD> Is it Dribbble worthy?
04:27:57 <zakmac> ElliotSH's is nicer :)
04:28:08 <zakmac> Only if you throw some gloss on that bitch
04:28:16 <zakmac> And make it look candy for iOS
04:28:17 <ElliotSH> I think a proper hipster logo would just be a black square, with white "Bob's cleaning" in times new roman in white.
04:28:29 <ElliotSH> zakmac, don't forget the outer glow.
04:28:35 <TheWhisper> http://hipsterbranding.tumblr.com/
04:28:35 <zakmac> And crop it to an obscure tiny section of the logo
04:29:24 <ElliotSH> The motorola one isn't that bad imo :(
04:29:34 <TheWhisper> Zakmac, I think the outer glow yellow is a little too yello
04:29:37 <TheWhisper> *yellow
04:29:54 <TheWhisper> Maybe pull from the 5 min myster logo color
04:30:04 <TheWhisper> but then again, what do i know about colors ;(
04:31:28 <ElliotSH> Whoever asked me for the logos, here's another one, from the header of their website: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Iq2Ao8Gk4Os/SeOlOSN7iWI/AAAAAAAAAB0/qCcG5AXLGu8/s320/Capital+City+Dry+Cleaners.jpeg
04:31:42 <TheWhisper> wait
04:31:47 <TheWhisper> they have 2 logos?
04:31:48 <marshmallow> <@zakmac> Main user base is 50+ <-- why would you want to target the older generation?
04:31:55 <ElliotSH> One is an email signature
04:32:00 <TheWhisper> lol
04:32:00 <ElliotSH> One is a header on a website
04:32:01 <TheWhisper> so dumb
04:32:02 <ElliotSH> fuck if I know
04:32:07 <zakmac> The whole site content and all targets them
04:32:09 <zakmac> And children
04:32:20 <TheWhisper> Marshmallow, we're not the only generation that spends money and uses things
04:32:21 <zakmac> So big maskable buttons are what I'm aiming for
04:32:23 <TheWhisper> lol
04:32:28 <marshmallow> so?
04:32:34 <TheWhisper> nah zak go ultra minimal
04:32:38 <TheWhisper> with 11 pt type
04:32:40 <zakmac> TheWhisper: circle the yellowy yellow please
04:32:41 <TheWhisper> on white bg
04:32:43 <TheWhisper> uh
04:32:47 <marshmallow> mostly everything on tv is advertised towards the 18-49year old demo
04:32:48 <ElliotSH> Oh, snap. That logo I linked wasn't some guy pissing around in word. They literally hired it out to some guy: http://jmharleydesign.blogspot.com/2009/04/capital-city-dry-cleaners.html
04:32:49 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/E2XGI.png
04:32:49 <EDSGD> I think I can help with that one.
04:32:51 <EDSGD> too
04:33:01 <EDSGD> want me to give it a shot?
04:33:03 <TheWhisper> Zak can you link to it again? accidentally closed it
04:33:11 <marshmallow> there's a BIG reason why people don't advertise for 50+
04:33:12 <EDSGD> I can see the font GOTHOM used.
04:33:14 <EDSGD> all caps
04:33:22 <EDSGD> with a lot of tracking
04:33:32 <zakmac> @me ED?
04:33:32 <TheWhisper> gothom
04:33:33 <TheWhisper> lol what
04:33:44 <zakmac> Ostrich Sans my man
04:33:48 <zakmac> LoMT4L
04:33:57 <TheWhisper> Zakmac, was it Col. Butler in the foyer with the caviar buttersticks?
04:34:14 <zakmac> Butter*dicks*, but close
04:34:17 <TheWhisper> lol
04:34:36 <marshmallow> <@TheWhisper> Marshmallow, we're not the only generation that spends money and uses things <- you're also not the generation living off of social security / retirement checks.
04:34:39 <zakmac> It's supposed to make you think of Sherlock's sitting room
04:35:02 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/76ZMx.jpg zakmac
04:35:08 <TheWhisper> red = very noticeable and weird
04:35:08 <zakmac> Site is free marshmallow. And let's note I'm not the marketing guy on this, merely a designer assigned a demographic and task
04:35:25 <TheWhisper> green = not as bad, but only because the bg is a different color
04:35:25 <zakmac> Hm
04:35:31 <TheWhisper> but then again, what do i know about colors ;(
04:35:40 * zakmac very loud contemplating noises
04:36:25 <marshmallow> lol, your marketer is an abnormal marketer
04:36:49 <ElliotSH> http://i.imgur.com/c04LS.jpg
04:36:55 <marshmallow> cause nearly everyone in the industry prefers 18-49 demo =p
04:37:09 <TheWhisper> Which means that the 50+ demo is an untapped market
04:37:12 <TheWhisper> ;)
04:37:20 <TheWhisper> Bob is cleaning?
04:37:23 <TheWhisper> What is bob cleaning?
04:37:26 <ElliotSH> No, the cleaning is bob.
04:37:34 <ElliotSH> Bob is being cleaned, spiritually.
04:37:37 <ElliotSH> Hence the minimalism.
04:37:39 <TheWhisper> .tell marshmallow if i have another baby, it'll be born in the united states!
04:37:44 <ElliotSH> He must clean himself from within
04:37:44 <marshmallow> easier to get them when they're younger and build brand loyalty.  thus you target 18-49 people who can stay with your brand longer 
04:37:51 <ElliotSH> before he can clean outside himself.
04:38:03 <marshmallow> -.-;
04:38:04 <TheWhisper> lol marshmallow, that's for some things
04:38:07 <TheWhisper> That's not a universal thing
04:38:15 <ElliotSH> If you website is a game site
04:38:18 <ElliotSH> Does it really matter?
04:38:18 <marshmallow> thus i said, ABnormal marketer XD
04:38:27 <TheWhisper> Just because they teach you that in advertising class, that doesn't mean that's how it always is ;)
04:38:33 <ElliotSH> Aside from google, I can't think of a site that has really lasted more than 10 years.
04:38:42 <TheWhisper> I should know - I learned that in an advertising class!
04:38:47 <TheWhisper> yahoo
04:38:49 <TheWhisper> aol
04:38:51 <TheWhisper> microsoft
04:38:58 <ElliotSH> Ehhhh
04:39:03 <TheWhisper> ask
04:39:07 <ElliotSH> I'm pretty certain those are stagnating
04:39:11 <ElliotSH> or declining
04:39:19 <ElliotSH> Or, at the very least, not growing with the rest of the industry.
04:39:30 <TheWhisper> hp.com
04:39:33 <ElliotSH> i'll check.
04:39:42 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/znunp.png
04:39:44 <zakmac> Checkmate.
04:39:46 <TheWhisper> linkedin.com
04:39:47 <ElliotSH> Microsoft, aol, and hp shouldn't count.
04:39:55 <ElliotSH> Those offer exterior services.
04:39:58 <TheWhisper> zakmac, that's racist
04:40:01 <marshmallow> meh.  that's what my clients ALWAYS wanted.  18-49.  
04:40:10 <zakmac> Whiet paur!
04:40:17 <ElliotSH> Holy shit.
04:40:20 <marshmallow> it's not something i learned from advertising classes =p
04:40:21 <ElliotSH> Zakmac, how much?
04:40:24 <TheWhisper> myspace is almost 10 years old
04:40:27 <TheWhisper> next year it will be
04:40:36 <ElliotSH> I need to buy that off you. Right. Now.
04:40:37 <TheWhisper> Xanga
04:40:45 <TheWhisper> livejournal
04:40:54 <TheWhisper> should i keep going?
04:40:58 <ElliotSH> TheWhisper you and your logic can fuck right off :P
04:41:02 <TheWhisper> lol
04:41:09 <ElliotSH> I have subjective evidence here
04:41:13 <zakmac> Sorry ElliotSH but I only accept out of print currency you probably never heard of
04:41:15 <ElliotSH> And there isn't room for your facts.
04:41:23 <ElliotSH> zakmac, may I pay you in bitcoins?
04:41:39 <ElliotSH> Or, starbucks gift cards, perhaps?
04:41:41 <TheWhisper> He only accepts titmice
04:41:58 <ElliotSH> Damn, I spent my last titmouse 2 fortnights ago.
04:42:06 <TheWhisper> btw zakmac, did you see this: http://vimeo.com/36293215
04:42:09 <ElliotSH> Do you accept titmouce IOU's?
04:42:10 <TheWhisper> I sent it to you
04:42:12 <TheWhisper> but you were gone
04:42:12 <ElliotSH> I'm willing to offer a 5% APR
04:42:13 <zakmac>    bien sûr que non!
04:42:20 <TheWhisper> I think it describes your life in Portland
04:42:33 <TheWhisper> Note: This is not the 1990s one
04:42:34 <zakmac> Ah TheWhisper no I saw it but was at work so never watched
04:42:37 <TheWhisper> It's the 1890s
04:42:39 <TheWhisper> totally different
04:42:41 <TheWhisper> watch it now :P
04:42:50 <ElliotSH> Alright, anyways, I have to finish a midterm paper. Thank you for your input & laughs, everyone :)
04:42:55 <TheWhisper> Also, it's really fucking catchy and still stuck in my head
04:42:57 <TheWhisper> No problemo
04:43:04 <TheWhisper> Let us know how the logo goes
04:43:25 <TheWhisper> microbreeww or dieee
04:43:48 <TheWhisper> they look like hasidic jews
04:44:42 <zakmac> I almost hit a chicken on SE Division last week
04:44:50 <zakmac> Scary accurate
04:45:34 <TheWhisper> lol
04:46:18 <zakmac> http://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/laf/3307494762.html
04:46:21 <zakmac> Just saying
04:46:31 <TheWhisper> Wanna read an interesting article that posits a theory on neue-hipsterism and why it's so anti-tech?
04:46:33 <TheWhisper> http://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2012/09/26/hipsters-and-low-tech/
04:46:40 <TheWhisper> Pretty intriguing
04:46:47 <TheWhisper> also LOL
04:48:34 <zakmac> Sparx is not low tech
04:48:43 <zakmac> That is some high-tech devilry right there
04:48:50 <zakmac> Witch's brew
04:49:09 <zakmac> Additionally, that picture is a photoshop disaster
04:49:41 <TheWhisper> http://userserve-ak.last.fm/serve/300x300/4918589.jpg
04:51:28 <zakmac> And every fixed-gear riding, full frame camera wielding, mustache waxing hipster stilll has a goddamn iPhone 3G S at minimum so don't act like you're so revivalist if you can't live without your lifeline to Instagram and Facebook to key the world in on how fucking awesome your sad life is
04:51:39 <zakmac> Now I'm all disgruntled

05:22:22 <TheWhisper> nah
05:22:27 <TheWhisper> one where 3 british girls in a car
05:22:29 <TheWhisper> were texting
05:22:31 <TheWhisper> and crash
05:22:39 <TheWhisper> .g british texting and driving psa crash

05:23:10 <TheWhisper> oh

05:26:50 <zakmac> No
05:27:09 <TheWhisper> lol
05:27:28 <TheWhisper> Revolution's visual FX guys have obviously enver used a smartphone
05:27:50 <zakmac> Androids have something kind of like that
05:28:04 <zakmac> Looks like a TV powering off (tube tv)
05:28:11 <TheWhisper> weird

06:37:29 <EDSGD> damnit damnit
06:37:41 <EDSGD> medos you request came a bit early
08:45:20 <zakmac> Anybody here?
08:51:04 <zakmac> http://imgur.com/a/pR2Jl#0
09:19:46 <Azra-el> the bg is a bit too proeminent for me... makes my eyes go sideways
09:20:28 <Azra-el> other then that.. id love to play the game asap :P
10:26:48 <medos> uhhhh
10:30:53 <medos> no
10:42:07 <medos> zakmac rule of thumb is: either content or background gets a texture or image
10:42:10 <medos> not both
10:42:27 <medos> i can't arrest you for doing it differently
10:42:46 <zakmac> No idea what you mean. Content has no bg
10:43:03 <medos> your wooden login button
10:43:22 <zakmac> Ah, img #2?
10:43:27 <medos> on a blurry restaurant scene backdrop
10:43:28 <medos> yeah
10:43:32 <medos> as well as image 1
10:43:44 <zakmac> I see your point on #2
10:43:58 <medos> i mean at most
10:44:22 <medos> make it textured but not real wood-esque
10:44:39 <medos> bleh, i suck at explaining 5 minutes after waking up
10:45:11 <zakmac> Shouldn't be on irc 5 minutes after waking up
10:45:58 <zakmac> I get ye though. I'll give it some thought over the workday. This is night 1 version 1
10:46:54 <medos> Yeah
10:47:00 <medos> it looks good already
10:47:18 <zakmac> I think a couple days contemplation I'll have something solid
10:47:21 <medos> (see you do get feedback if i feel it's interesting)
10:47:22 <medos> http://www.pocopeople.com.au/
10:47:34 <medos> ^ logo top center
10:47:50 <medos> that kind of texture would be the most you should do to your login/main menu buttons
10:47:57 <medos> not make them actual wood
10:48:42 <zakmac> Eh, not going for a grungy look
10:49:06 <zakmac> I need to think about the nab blocks though, the wood makes the icons hard to spot
10:49:15 <zakmac> Which is pretty counter intuitive
10:50:38 <medos> i was refering to amount of texturizing
10:50:41 <medos> not the texture itself
10:51:02 <zakmac> Well if you look at it toward the middle all the colors mush
10:54:57 <zakmac> Anyway, thanks for the notes. I've gotta get some sleep before work. Later
10:55:37 <medos> good night man

15:44:23 <medos> gmail is ok, livemail is better
15:45:10 <marshmallow> why livemail = better?
15:48:20 <medos> gmail automates too much stuff
15:51:00 <medos> why would gmail be better?
15:52:44 <medos> gmail wastes screen real estate
15:54:25 <medos> gmails filter does not work well
15:54:37 <medos> compared to livemail sweep
15:54:47 <medos> gmail has no preview pane built in
15:54:55 <medos> just a labs feature
15:55:47 <marshmallow> my filters work wonderfully
15:55:49 <medos> gmail , just like google.com tends to randomly hit you with a new feature because your account is in the 1% of testing population that gets chosen
15:56:22 <marshmallow> gmail lets you join convos together

16:14:45 <medos> conversation view
16:15:16 <marshmallow> oh.  mine is more spammy
16:15:18 <marshmallow> ish
16:16:05 <medos> those messages are longer, i can click to expand, looks like your thingie
16:16:21 <marshmallow> mine are mostly one-liners
16:16:26 <marshmallow> =o
16:18:17 <marshmallow> the worse was when somebody sent a message to a few hundred people on a few listserves
16:18:24 <marshmallow> it became spammy really quickly
16:18:32 <marshmallow> and crashed my college's entire server
16:19:19 <marshmallow> I ended up getting a few hundred e-mails in less than an hour or so
16:19:37 <marshmallow> good thing google bunched it up =D
16:19:54 <medos> lol
16:20:28 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/cru8i.png

16:42:52 <medos> not a second earlier
16:44:37 <marshmallow> >_<;;
16:44:59 <marshmallow> ya know...  like..  3-4ish years ago I used to make websites
16:45:07 <marshmallow> it took me a whole month
16:45:13 <marshmallow> don't expect anything anytime soon

19:39:15 <TheWhisper> ?
19:39:17 <TheWhisper> I've been here
19:39:27 <EDSGD> What is your stance on genetically enhanced food
19:40:02 <TheWhisper> Hm
19:40:10 <TheWhisper> On the physical process itself?
19:40:19 <TheWhisper> Or on the current implementation of it across the globe?
19:40:27 <EDSGD> Implementation.
19:40:47 <adding_confusion> I am for it for developing countries, it can help get needed nutrition into mouths.  I am against it it makes my oranges taste bad.
19:43:52 <TheWhisper> The current implementation is, by and large, terrible.
19:43:59 <TheWhisper> Especially when you get into companies like Monsanto
19:44:11 <TheWhisper> Who genetically engineer their seeds to /only produce for a year/
19:44:19 <TheWhisper> So that farmers need to buy from them every single year
19:53:57 <EDSGD> thanks it helped a bit.
19:57:46 <TheWhisper> lol
19:57:48 <TheWhisper> What are you doing
19:57:58 <EDSGD> I have to do some campaign for this shit.
19:58:18 <EDSGD> For class since its going to be in the november ballot in california
19:58:34 <EDSGD> whether to allow us to label genitically modified foods
19:58:37 <EDSGD> and stuff.
19:58:51 <EDSGD> How should I go about this. Any thoughts?
19:59:00 <EDSGD> an infographic maybe lol
19:59:02 <EDSGD> xD
19:59:30 <TheWhisper> Do some clever guerilla thing
19:59:37 <TheWhisper> that involves like
19:59:41 <TheWhisper> actually putting stuff on food
20:00:32 <EDSGD> That's what I was thinking.
20:00:42 <EDSGD> not sure exactly what.
20:00:48 <EDSGD> Also its a group project. 
20:01:13 <EDSGD> Which sucks. Group things usually don't work for some reason.
20:02:09 <TheWhisper> :(
20:02:19 <TheWhisper> Probs cuz you're either in here or in your tutees

20:04:18 <EDSGD> Also the lamest excuse I get when I do group things is "I didn't receive your e-mail"

20:11:33 <TheWhisper> I'll only tell you if you look at my thing ^
20:11:42 <EDSGD> tutees sounds just like me
20:11:43 <adding_confusion> @EDSGD Bill gates did some talks in support of GMOs that might be worth watching
20:11:56 <EDSGD> I always cheat on exams  I don't have time to study
20:11:58 <EDSGD> :p
20:13:23 <TheWhisper> Just realized the shelf was 1 px in on the right side lol
20:13:25 <TheWhisper> whoops
20:14:01 <EDSGD> TheWhisper looks like the start of a bad porno http://i.imgur.com/wyKUq.png

20:14:11 <TheWhisper> LOL
20:14:18 <TheWhisper> Wanna see what it actually is?
20:14:23 <EDSGD> Yes.
20:15:06 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/dvunl.jpg
20:15:11 <EDSGD> This is for the ipad right?
20:15:18 <TheWhisper> Yes
20:15:18 <EDSGD> HAHHA
20:15:22 <TheWhisper> and browser too
20:15:23 <TheWhisper> but 
20:15:26 <TheWhisper> mainly ipad first
20:15:42 <adding_confusion> hey those colors look good, the search and scroll bar especially
20:15:57 <EDSGD> Maybe just me, but I preferred when the nav filter thing was on the left.
20:16:03 <EDSGD> Just feels odd on the top.
20:16:25 <adding_confusion> throw the brazzers logo on it 
20:16:26 <TheWhisper> hm
20:16:45 <TheWhisper> Yeah, the left seemed like it had potential
20:16:45 <EDSGD> .g GMO bill gates
20:16:56 <TheWhisper> but it just didn't really fit there
20:18:01 <adding_confusion> yeah bill gates is all over that stuff, grow corn rice and wheat to better sustain the climate in africa
20:18:14 <adding_confusion> feed everyone, story book ending
20:18:30 <adding_confusion> loving this simple poster campaign http://designenvy.aiga.org/israel-loves-iran-ronny-edry/
20:21:32 <EDSGD> LOL Design Envy deleted one of my comments when I criticized them lol
20:21:48 <EDSGD> Free-speech amirite.
20:21:53 <EDSGD> ;p
20:22:44 <TheWhisper> lol
20:24:28 <EDSGD> Wasn't even anonymous.
20:24:29 <EDSGD> :D
20:24:39 <EDSGD> Anyway back to TheWhisper
20:25:56 <EDSGD> To sublte. http://i.imgur.com/8wLAg.png
20:26:08 <EDSGD> Also why is it on the left.
20:26:09 <EDSGD> ??
20:26:19 <EDSGD> Seems kind of confusing. 
20:26:53 <EDSGD> When I saw it without reading it I assumed it was a button than sends me to the previous page.
20:27:38 <EDSGD> Also what's the point of having an "story 2" button?
20:27:58 <EDSGD> I can just as easily swipe upward to go to the next thing that "CLICK"
20:28:09 <EDSGD> mind my messy writing,
20:28:12 <TheWhisper> What
20:28:16 <EDSGD> :p
20:28:27 <TheWhisper> you mean
20:28:42 <TheWhisper> the index = *
20:28:49 <TheWhisper> the story 1 = ~
20:28:54 <TheWhisper> story 2 = P
20:28:56 <TheWhisper> it's laid out like
20:29:01 <TheWhisper> * ~ P
20:29:04 <TheWhisper> so left goes to the index
20:29:07 <TheWhisper> and right goes to the next story
20:29:10 <TheWhisper> if I'm on story 2
20:29:11 <TheWhisper> and I go left

21:20:45 <marshmallow> LOL
21:20:53 <marshmallow> he didn't
21:21:02 <marshmallow> and my caps lock was on.  i didn't laugh that loud
21:21:29 <zakmac> Colloquy should really confirm when leaving a room since people tend to multitask and its not good at indicating key focus
21:21:51 <zakmac> Then why "lol?"  All the lies are piling up, marshmallow 
21:22:45 <marshmallow> mai bad
21:23:21 <marshmallow> weeeeee.  time to bounce.  yay!

22:02:35 <adding_confusion> @zakmac work brought me here. I work for an outdoor education school (NOLS)
22:03:01 <zakmac> All I ever noticed in Wyoming was gas workers and Laramie
22:04:12 <TheWhisper> Malaria?
22:04:25 <adding_confusion> im in the one redeeming town of Lander. Jackson Hole doesnt count its technically part of California.
22:05:10 <adding_confusion> Lots of art and lots of climbing, good access to the mountains too. I am going culture crazy though. Almost time to make it back to civilization.

22:06:57 <TheWhisper> HSB = Hydrangea, Saturation, Blueness?
22:06:58 <medos> sorry for channelspam
22:07:04 <medos> no
22:07:11 <medos> your page still looks ugly btw.
22:07:18 <medos> your joking will not make it better
22:07:19 <medos> :P
22:07:28 <TheWhisper> :(
22:08:14 <TheWhisper> ugly because: 1) the colors I'm using are bad or 2) I'm not using the colors well
22:08:15 <TheWhisper> ?
22:09:05 <zakmac> Two days in Laramie was plenty of Wyoming for one lifetime. There was a great little tea shop on Main St though with a great woman running it. I actually stopped by on my way back through earlier this year to say hi and have some of her green tea
22:09:44 <zakmac> TheWhisper: I like this most of what you've shown me thus far
22:10:08 <TheWhisper> Yay
22:10:13 <adding_confusion> you live in colorado?
22:10:24 <zakmac> You is me?
22:10:29 <zakmac> No, I live in Oregon
22:10:31 <adding_confusion> yes
22:10:53 <adding_confusion> oh nice. I love hood river. 
22:11:20 <adding_confusion> the whole east half of oregon is alot like wyoming i think....
22:12:18 <zakmac> Every part of WY I saw disgusted me
22:12:33 <zakmac> Mainly because Laramie took full advantage of us
22:13:23 <zakmac> (Car blew up on a Sunday and apparently WY shuts down on Sunday) then the only place we could get towed to took one look at the car on Monday and informed us it was shot and we'd have to buy a new car there (luckily they sold cars! Whaddya know?)
22:14:00 <TheWhisper> Oh, hue saturation brightness
22:14:01 <TheWhisper> duh
22:14:54 <medos> seriously?
22:15:07 <medos> 7 minutes :(
22:16:09 <TheWhisper> Lol
22:16:14 <TheWhisper> I only just looked it up
22:16:23 <TheWhisper> Was not looking that entire time ;)
22:16:43 <medos> even worse
22:17:06 <TheWhisper> k cuz working on my website is worse
22:20:40 <zakmac> http://imgur.com/a/ZbxVB#0 (wyoming is the first image only, then…) OREGON, F*CK YEAH
22:25:07 <adding_confusion> will be in portland for the first time at the end of the month to provide web and social support to the wilderness risk management conference
22:25:37 <adding_confusion> love the juxtaposition of wyoming and oregon there 
22:29:10 <adding_confusion> my only rebuttal is: http://static.panoramio.com/photos/original/1577477.jpg
22:30:26 <TheWhisper> zakmac, do you think the site is too flat? 
22:30:49 <TheWhisper> Like do you think subtle gradients for the backgrounds and such should be added?
22:32:46 <zakmac> Wowza, adding_confusion 
22:33:21 <zakmac> adding_confusion: You should definitely get in touch when you're in town. I'd like to meet a fellow web geek since most here are elitist hipster type of geek which is offputting
22:33:45 <TheWhisper> ##r-gd meetup!
22:34:13 <zakmac> TheWhisper isn't invited (his bathing habits disturb me)
22:34:25 <TheWhisper> Which ones?
22:34:25 * zakmac mutters "or lack thereof..."
22:34:34 <zakmac> Ohh too fast
22:34:38 <zakmac> Too fast for you
22:34:41 <zakmac> Oh yeeeeh
22:34:43 <TheWhisper> lol
22:35:00 <TheWhisper> I'll have you know
22:35:07 <TheWhisper> I bathe in a lamb's blood at least once a day
22:37:04 <zakmac> Personal space is a thing and your musk kills that
22:37:31 <TheWhisper> lol
