01:10:22 <shutterxflash> ahhh
01:10:25 <shutterxflash> ohhhh
01:10:33 <shutterxflash> hope everyone is still here lol
01:10:41 <shutterxflash> my client is looking to spend $50
01:10:47 <shutterxflash> she just wants the type refined
01:13:52 <medos> hm
01:14:11 <medos> Most people are always here. :-P
01:16:22 <medos> There's www.reddit.com/r/forhire and www.reddit.com/r/designjobs
01:16:42 <medos> You might find someone if you make a new post there.
01:19:02 <shutterxflash> ohhh okay
01:19:04 <shutterxflash> :/
01:19:44 <medos> Do you have any specific information?
01:20:51 <edodes> question: is an e-mail agreement "in writing" or should I send a pdf contract and have them sign and send it back?
01:20:53 <medos> "touching up" is a bit general, there are too many fonts styles to just guess.
01:21:05 <edodes> hey medos
01:21:13 <edodes> when do you sleep?
01:21:50 <medos> edodes http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/08/15/free-download-useful-legal-documents-for-designers-pdf/
01:21:54 <medos> Sometimes?
01:22:19 <edodes> thanks for the link!
01:22:27 <edodes> I'm convinced you're a robot
01:22:30 <edodes> that just needs to recharge
01:22:33 <medos> Thanks for making use of it.
01:24:09 <medos> shutterxflash if you know what font & text & color & alignment the new logo should have I could tell you my email and i'll see what i can do
01:26:58 <edodes> medos: Have you used Docracy before for digital signatures?
01:27:56 <edodes> nvm read something wrong...
01:29:23 <edodes> or did I?!?!
01:30:06 <EDSGD> Hello.
01:30:12 <edodes> hey
01:30:15 <edodes> helloy
01:30:43 <medos> edodes http://www.alistapart.com/topics/process/business/
01:31:13 <edodes> I jsut want to be done with the family favors @.@
01:31:16 <edodes> just*
01:31:26 <edodes> I swear my keyboard hates that word
01:33:10 <edodes> o I like this one
01:33:11 <edodes> http://www.alistapart.com/articles/agreements-equal-expectations/
01:34:24 <medos> 3 minutes
01:34:26 <medos> fast reader
01:34:34 <edodes> haven't finished yet...
01:34:56 <edodes> just pointing out I like it xD
01:35:14 <edodes> Still reading about the differences between an MSA & SOW
01:36:41 <medos> yup
01:36:53 <medos> soon you'll have no excuse for client problems anymore
01:36:54 <medos> :p
01:36:59 <edodes> lol
01:37:36 <edodes> seeing as I don't ever want to do this for a living I'm hoping to just get their stuff done and then buy a nice x-mas present heh
01:38:52 <edodes> hmm
01:39:03 <edodes> reading about the PSA... seems a bit much...
01:39:33 <edodes> Next, the PSA provides an overview of the history of our company, talks about our differentiators, and includes bios of our people.
01:39:43 <edodes> course I guess it's different for their large company...
01:42:48 <edodes> "Bucket those hours"
01:42:52 <edodes> learned THAT the hard way
01:43:08 <shutterxflash> hahaha lol
01:43:18 <shutterxflash> well, the types need to be changed
01:43:30 <shutterxflash> and starbursts added on the text
01:43:33 <shutterxflash> that's it really.
01:44:50 <medos> i have about 10,000 fonts or more in my library
01:45:03 <medos> and i wouldn't know where to place those starbursts
01:45:03 <edodes> that freezes my computer @.@
01:45:31 <shutterxflash> haha, oh no, the two fonts have already been picked out.
01:45:55 <shutterxflash> and starbursts, they want applied just in small spots
01:46:03 <shutterxflash> honestly, i wouldn't put the starbursts on the text
01:46:07 <shutterxflash> especially it being white
01:46:40 <edodes> http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pricing-strategy-for-creatives/ <-- somehow managed to do exactly this, this time around
01:46:53 <edodes> specifically the different pricing options
01:46:58 <edodes> yay I'm learnign so much medos
01:47:01 <edodes> learning*
01:48:42 <medos> shutterxflash mail me the logo psd, the font files, a png/jpg file of the logo where you clearly mark the spots where those starbursts are supposed to go and roughly circle their supposed size, then you add the colors for those fonts ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors < snag them from here) and the actual text that's supposed to go there
01:49:20 <medos> you mail all of that to michael.buck@live.de
01:49:28 <medos> i should have it done in an hour or so
01:49:40 <medos> then you donate those 50 bux to https://www.redditdonate.com/donate/89
01:50:50 <medos> (when i'm done)
01:50:56 <medos> obviously
01:51:05 <medos> if you don't pay you cheated a charity out of money ;)
01:52:53 <medos> if it's two fonts
01:52:59 <medos> specify which is supposed to go where
01:53:02 <shutterxflash> haha, sickkkk
01:53:05 <shutterxflash> :)
01:53:10 <medos> and tell me if it's supposed to have a stroke like the old one had
01:53:21 <shutterxflash> will email you in twenty
01:53:28 <shutterxflash> and yes, it is.
01:54:32 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/wby9b.png <-
01:54:45 <medos> need both of those for each piece of text
02:00:30 <shutterxflash> right right got itl.
02:01:01 <edodes> medos: rememeber the "favor logo" I did?
02:01:50 <medos> Nope, never seen it.
02:02:03 <medos> You did talk about it though.
02:02:14 <edodes> well I got paid/finished it whatever
02:02:18 <edodes> got a call a few days ago
02:02:24 <edodes> she couldn't figure out how to change the colors
02:02:36 <edodes> felt so good to say "sorry, can't help you"
02:02:55 <edodes> that's the gist of it anyways
02:06:54 <medos> could've offered tutoring
02:07:08 <edodes> She didn't have illustrator
02:07:09 <medos> hourly rate and go
02:07:13 <edodes> lol
02:07:26 <edodes> no I was happy to be done. Told her to try googling it
02:08:50 <edodes> I also have no clue how to tutor anyone, so it'd be kind of a moot point
02:09:00 <edodes> I probably just used that word wrong
02:16:01 <EDSGD> Did someone say tutoring? 
02:16:15 <medos> edsgdoring
02:16:23 <edodes> why? you offering? xD
02:16:38 <EDSGD> No. I'm done for now.

03:14:29 <EDSGD> Should I build "Cooler Pal" with that?
03:15:08 <medos> Could've done that before already.
03:15:56 <medos> .tell EDSGD http://www.adobe.com/products/flex.html
03:16:35 <EDSGD> I forgot about that :p
03:16:54 <medos> YAAAY APPS
03:16:57 <medos> A year ago.
03:17:03 <medos> :P
03:20:01 <medos> shutterxflash !
03:20:09 <medos> did you mean 20 minutes or twenty hours?
03:20:12 <medos> i'll take a nap soon
03:20:24 <medos> so the whole thing might take a little longer
03:21:34 <shutterxflash> oh wow, so sorry.
03:21:39 <shutterxflash> i got sidetracked.
03:21:43 <shutterxflash> eep sending now.
03:21:46 <shutterxflash> my bad.
03:22:04 <medos> lol
03:22:35 <medos> if you really just discovered reddit
03:22:57 <medos> it's obvious that you got sidetracked
03:23:09 <medos> .u eep
03:30:09 <medos> That's awesome, i haven't heard that term in years.
03:30:23 <shutterxflash> hahahah
03:30:30 <shutterxflash> sorry
03:30:38 <medos> no i thought it's actually funny
03:30:42 <shutterxflash> which would you recommend for sending?
03:30:47 <shutterxflash> sendspace?
03:30:54 <medos> how big is that thing?
03:31:01 <shutterxflash> 120mb
03:31:33 <medos> http://jumpshare.com/
03:31:54 <medos> dang
03:31:57 <medos> 100mb file limit
03:32:34 <shutterxflash> hahah
03:32:35 <shutterxflash> yeahh
03:32:39 <shutterxflash> was just typing that up
03:32:47 <shutterxflash> i think sendspace should be goood
03:33:01 <shutterxflash> anyone remember drop.io? rip
03:33:20 <medos> do you use dropbox?
03:33:42 <medos> or google drive?
03:33:44 <shutterxflash> negative
03:34:11 <medos> dropbox double-acts as cloud backup and sharing and filehosting thingie
03:34:58 <medos> if you sign up through this link: http://db.tt/5epv8x1
03:35:02 <medos> i'll get extra space
03:35:06 <medos> and you too :P
03:35:17 <shutterxflash> ha, well i just did sendspace
03:35:20 <shutterxflash> :/
03:35:32 <medos> yup sendspace is fine too
03:35:32 <shutterxflash> but if you want, i'll get you more space for sure, if its a problem
03:35:34 <medos> just in general
03:35:39 <shutterxflash> alright rad
03:35:55 <medos> i have yet to find someone who does not like dropbox
03:36:26 <medos> major advantage really only comes into play when you install the desktop app
03:36:34 <medos> then you have a folder on your hard drive that auto uploads
03:37:22 <shutterxflash> you do graphic design?
03:37:28 <shutterxflash> well, inititally
03:37:29 <shutterxflash> ha
03:37:32 <shutterxflash> *initially
03:37:54 <medos> sometimes
03:38:03 <medos> more talk than do as a freelancer
03:38:55 <medos> :P
03:43:47 <EDSGD> PSD files are a pain in the ass when they are huge
03:45:08 <medos> oh noes
03:45:12 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/eHr23.png hooray
03:46:08 <EDSGD> What exactly am I looking at?
03:46:35 <EDSGD> I see a green arrow with three digits so hooraaayyy
03:46:47 <medos> fridge pal went from rank 9xx to 6xx
03:46:49 <medos> in a day

06:06:40 <zakmac> I also just bought gassy for the short url service I plan on running on the domain
06:06:44 <zakmac> gas.sy
06:07:08 <TheWhisper> um
06:07:13 <TheWhisper> are you also doing design for it?
06:07:27 <zakmac> Ex: gas.sy/gDw351a or something to link to your specific route that you planned (with your car info set if you chose a vehicle)
06:07:44 <zakmac> Yeah, but function is my main priority right now
06:07:48 <TheWhisper> okay :p

06:08:26 <TheWhisper> I think we can cut it down to maybe 2-3 decimal places, eh?
06:09:06 <zakmac> When I get to it that'll end up "X days, X hours, X minutes"

16:10:53 <medos> *does not look fun to set up and code and arrange and filter
16:11:11 <zakmac> Yeah, sad part is that's not the main function of the site at all, but oh well at least it'll work nicely
16:11:27 <zakmac> Code's not too bad. Though I'm horrible. One sec

21:47:00 <Carson> I'm doing some homework

21:48:30 <EDSGD_> Finished my LP
21:48:35 <EDSGD_> medos is proud of me.
21:48:36 <EDSGD_> :D
21:49:35 <EDSGD_> wtf http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mam0dyg8b21rdkdfso4_r1_1280.jpg
21:49:36 <EDSGD_> ahhaha
21:49:45 <EDSGD_> <3 the randomness 
21:50:43 <EDSGD_> hey pick challenge 6 man. I really want to do it! :0
21:52:23 <medos> Carson you are free to choose and have no idea what to do?
21:52:38 <medos> EDSGD_ i thought about making a vector challenge this time but no idea yet
21:53:16 <EDSGD_> make a super detailed app icon that is dribbble worthy :3
21:53:36 <Carson> yeah pretty much, we are supposed to compare/contrast two theories of creativity from different disciplines 
21:55:35 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VShmtsLhkQg @ Carson
21:56:25 <medos> from http://99u.com/articles/7225/10-(More)-Amazing-Videos-About-the-Creative-Process
21:57:05 <EDSGD_> Hey medos link them to EDSGD please
21:57:06 <EDSGD_> :D
21:57:14 <EDSGD_> going to get off soon.
21:57:16 <medos> .tell EDSGD scroll up
21:57:19 <medos> thank you
21:57:23 <EDSGD_> please
21:57:27 <EDSGD_> HAHAHAHA
21:57:38 <EDSGD_> Lp
21:57:40 <EDSGD_> Later
21:57:44 <medos> bye
21:57:56 <Carson> I think I'm supposed to pick something like  physics v. psychology, or dance v. business
21:59:31 <Carson> but those sound like a pain
21:59:34 <medos> at least two of those videos
21:59:39 <medos> are related to business
21:59:46 <medos> psychology could be counted as funny
22:00:22 <medos> design could be counted anyway
22:00:32 <medos> so i guess all 10 of those are relevant to your assignment
22:01:28 <Carson> thanks  i'll be back in a minute

22:12:10 <Carson> no just moving location
22:12:27 <Carson> but most of the time I have terrible wifi at my apartment
22:15:41 <Carson> i'm thinking about doing something able industrial design
22:16:26 <Carson> about*
22:16:42 <medos> let me guess
22:16:44 <medos> Dieter Rams
22:18:01 <Carson> yeah that would be a good example 
22:19:19 <Carson> i have no idea what how this paper is supposed to work really :/ 
22:19:22 <Carson> lame paper 
22:20:14 <Carson> I could compare/contrast fine arts with industrial design
22:20:40 <medos> you make it sound like that assignment is very vague
22:21:24 <Carson> it is
22:22:14 <Carson> I can come up with a topic, but I guess I just have trouble coming up with thesis and main points 
22:22:59 <Carson> i'm ranting over here
22:26:47 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/z3gwj.png
22:27:36 <medos> *for
22:27:37 <medos> even
22:27:38 <medos> meh
22:28:16 <Carson> haha 
22:30:33 <TheWhisper> Carson
22:30:34 <TheWhisper> do
22:30:46 <TheWhisper> Assigned essay questions vs freeform essay assignments
22:30:52 <Carson> haha
22:31:11 <Carson> that's very creative of you 
22:31:31 <Carson> but I need "academic sources"
22:31:54 <TheWhisper> um
22:32:12 <TheWhisper> analog vs digital technologies
22:32:13 <TheWhisper> ;)
22:33:22 <Carson> hmm that doesn't sound bad 
22:55:13 <Carson> well thanks for the help, I think I've decided on fine arts v. industrial design
