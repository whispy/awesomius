It's relatively simple and I have the logo. shouldn't take more than 5 minutes. And I don't think /r/design is the right place to post it. Can someone help me out or point me to a good sub for this kind of thing?

It's to go on carts with drinks that are being offered for free from us for passengers on the new airline.

I just wanted something a little better than a word doc. light mood business casual. The only thing I was provided logo wise was http://imgur.com/a/JUbjG. You'd be giving away the right, if there are any rights to give. not a lot of people would see it tbh. 30 passengers max. it's a pretty small scale thing.
