00:12:19 <medos> today/tomorrow rather
00:12:19 <Kocho> nice
00:12:25 <Kocho> liking the text a lot
00:12:50 <medos> thaaaaaank you
00:12:52 <Kocho> i reckon add some minor highlights on the symbol
00:13:01 <Kocho> just so it looks even deeper
00:13:04 <medos> i'm not sure if that needs to be in there at all
00:13:18 <Kocho> they probably don't pair all that well as they look now
00:14:03 <Kocho> like, the symbol is inner shadowed and plain whereas the type is a bit more intense, steal looking
00:14:18 <medos> taking it out then :p
00:14:19 <Kocho> and i reckon add some minor glows to the text too
00:14:31 <Kocho> only to the edges
00:14:36 <Kocho> maybe to the top left point of the A
00:14:56 <medos> don't overdo it, it's mainly for them to see tomorrow
00:15:05 <medos> then i'll fix it up i guess
00:15:21 <Kocho> only a few ideas
00:15:23 <Kocho> not that it's wrong
00:15:40 <medos> yeah

01:09:17 <TheWhisper> HM
01:09:32 <medos> (02:49:33) (@TheWhisper): if there's like
01:09:32 <medos> (02:49:35) (@TheWhisper): a tray or tab
01:09:32 <medos> (02:49:36) (@TheWhisper): off screen
01:09:32 <medos> (02:49:41) (@TheWhisper): you swipe that thing
01:09:32 <medos> (02:49:44) (@TheWhisper): to drag it in
01:09:37 <TheWhisper> I see
01:09:40 <medos> you saw?
01:09:45 <medos> what i meant?
01:09:51 <medos> and what your profs meant
01:10:35 <TheWhisper> what they meant was http://i.imgur.com/03S0U.png
01:10:39 <TheWhisper> they literally show me their phone
01:10:45 <TheWhisper> and swiped it up and down
01:10:45 <TheWhisper> lol
01:10:52 <TheWhisper> But I see what you mean
01:10:56 <medos> yeah
01:11:01 <medos> vague description is vague
01:11:30 <TheWhisper> contextually
01:11:34 <TheWhisper> the ipad one
01:11:36 <TheWhisper> i mean
01:11:38 <TheWhisper> the youtube one
01:11:41 <TheWhisper> doesn't make sense
01:11:47 <medos> oh it does
01:11:53 <medos> a lot more than what you're planning to do
01:11:54 <TheWhisper> tbh
01:11:59 <medos> :P
01:12:06 <TheWhisper> I don't think it does though
01:12:08 <TheWhisper> well
01:12:12 <TheWhisper> i don't have an ipad
01:12:12 <TheWhisper> so idk
01:12:18 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/7Tfwz.png
01:12:31 <medos> "it's the new standard for swiping icons"
01:12:37 <TheWhisper> So 
01:12:39 <TheWhisper> Does that thing
01:12:42 <TheWhisper> that's 
01:12:44 <TheWhisper> sort isn't it?
01:12:58 <medos> no
01:13:05 <TheWhisper> row reorder
01:13:08 <TheWhisper> is what it is
01:13:09 <medos> it's an icon that indicates that you can interact with an item via push button
01:13:11 <medos> yeah
01:13:18 <medos> reorder by tapping and dragging
01:13:26 <medos> now the youtube video might not have been the best example
01:13:31 <medos> but most slide out side menus
01:13:35 <medos> have that very same button
01:13:39 <medos> like
01:13:40 <TheWhisper> I see
01:13:43 <TheWhisper> that's dumb
01:13:44 <TheWhisper> but I see
01:13:47 <TheWhisper> okay then

04:09:34 <TheWhisper> The iPad's scrollbar is only 10 px wide?
04:09:35 <TheWhisper> interesting
04:09:43 <Kocho> that is interesting
04:09:51 <TheWhisper> I'm trying to make a scrollbar
04:09:56 <TheWhisper> and I had it at 44 px
04:09:57 <TheWhisper> and was like
04:10:00 <TheWhisper> 'this doesn't look right'
04:10:04 <TheWhisper> now I know why :P
04:13:54 <Kocho> ps isn't moving.

04:19:15 <Kocho> hrmm
04:20:06 <medos> this reminds me Kocho, in case you ever try to save a photoshop file and get "unkown error" or "can't save file"
04:20:30 <medos> create a layer comp saving the composition
04:20:41 <zakmac> Terrible cliché logo says what? http://i.imgur.com/Vk407.png
04:20:42 <medos> then deactivate visibility for all layers
04:20:57 <medos> and save
04:20:59 <medos> :P
04:21:10 <medos> works for me (had this error quite a few times today)

04:35:57 <zakmac> So any thoughts on gassy vs fuelnanny.com?
04:35:59 <TheWhisper> the scrollbar
04:36:00 <TheWhisper> and the buttons
04:36:04 <TheWhisper> do they seem too small to press?
04:36:16 <medos> zakmac i liked fuelnanny more
04:36:28 <TheWhisper> ^ same
04:36:28 <medos> you know why though

04:46:44 <medos> yes you can
04:47:03 <zakmac> Hm, that'd save me a buncha time making comps...
04:47:20 <zakmac> This from the guy who just figured out how to remove "copy" from duplicate layers
04:47:55 <zakmac> http://imgur.com/Sbukm - caught picking my nose

04:48:45 <Kocho> typeface
04:49:11 <zakmac> No
04:50:34 <zakmac> Why not just duplicate the layer though
04:51:35 <medos> why not just make a paragraph style?
04:51:40 <medos> from the one you have
04:51:50 <medos> then select the type layer you want changed
04:51:54 <medos> and remove overrides?
04:52:01 <Kocho> omfg
04:52:02 <Kocho> when
04:52:03 <Kocho> was
04:52:07 <Kocho> that started?

05:11:33 <medos> voted: TheWhisper (y)

05:12:15 <medos> .gis milea
05:12:19 <zakmac> Well shit I could just duplicate the codebase and have a techy one for geeks and fuel nanny for my grandma
05:12:23 <medos> aight
05:12:37 <TheWhisper> I wanna get whisp.er
05:12:40 <TheWhisper> but eritrea sucks
05:12:46 <zakmac> I did apply for zak.zm tonight
05:12:52 <zakmac> I'd be happy to get that
05:12:56 <zakmac> And zakm.ac
05:13:03 <zakmac> Hopefully I hear back by tomorrow
05:13:10 <TheWhisper> noice
05:13:29 <medos> i applied for .free
05:13:39 <zakmac> I tried to buy facebook.cm, porn.cm and sex.cm a few years back but they denied me :(
05:13:56 <zakmac> Was just gonna google ads it and hope for typos
05:14:05 <TheWhisper> lol
05:14:11 <TheWhisper> good way to get sued
05:14:16 <zakmac> Sue your FACE
05:14:19 <TheWhisper> book
05:14:51 <zakmac> Also: http://domai.nr/
05:15:08 <zakmac> But their "available/unavailable" is semi-inaccurate
05:15:36 <zakmac> They say .sy isn't a valid extension but thats only because there's no super easy way to purchase it. You need to fax/snail mail requests
05:16:03 <TheWhisper> http://www.iana.org/domains/root/db/om.html = n.om
05:16:07 <zakmac> Same for .cm (cameroon) you need to email the head IT guy in the country and he has an @yahoo mailbox
05:16:15 <TheWhisper> hahaha
05:16:17 <TheWhisper> cameroon
05:16:19 <TheWhisper> oh you
05:16:21 <zakmac> Oh n.om would be awesome for this menu app
05:16:31 <zakmac> omn.om
05:16:42 <TheWhisper> http://ethn.io/
05:16:43 <medos> PR.OM/gas
05:16:45 <TheWhisper> that's cool
05:16:55 <TheWhisper> I'd think from the domain it would be like an ethnic profiling site
05:17:02 <TheWhisper> prom gas?
05:17:26 <ImALegend> if you do a website for a client and you have to give them a psd with 5 or 6 'pages' do you just send one massive psd?
05:17:40 <TheWhisper> I would say no
05:17:50 <medos> i would say
05:17:52 <medos> ?psd
05:18:08 <TheWhisper> ?right
05:18:17 <TheWhisper> Awesomius, how are you?
05:18:22 <TheWhisper> lame

05:30:32 <EDSGD> Guys.
05:30:45 <EDSGD> Just saw a super cool movie called "The Wave"
05:31:03 <zakmac> Saw it a couple weeks back
05:31:10 <zakmac> Thought it was hilarious
05:31:21 <EDSGD> Its funny because it true.
05:31:27 <zakmac> And reminded me of the Tea Party :(
05:31:59 <EDSGD> They're dead.
05:32:14 <medos> the original is better
05:32:18 <zakmac> Someone posted it to r/netflixbestof a few weeks back
05:32:19 <medos> not sure which one you watched
05:32:26 <zakmac> You mean Hitler, medos?
05:32:44 <EDSGD> God.
05:32:48 <zakmac> At least his cronies didn't off themselves until they accomplished more
05:32:50 <medos> .g the wave 1981
05:33:18 <medos> ^
05:33:26 <medos> unlikely that you watched this one
05:33:36 <EDSGD> Yes.
05:33:52 <medos> http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4689717947890475769
05:33:56 <medos> we can fix that
05:34:37 <EDSGD> I'll watch it tomorrow.
05:34:50 <medos> not reaaally neccessary
05:34:57 <EDSGD> Its educational.
05:34:58 <medos> you might as well skip to about 40 minutes
05:35:00 <medos> in
05:35:13 <medos> it's the same story but better execution
05:35:16 <TheWhisper> um
05:35:23 <TheWhisper> What's the standard for side to side swiping
05:35:25 <TheWhisper> between things
05:35:28 <TheWhisper> is it just the caret?
05:35:42 <TheWhisper> That's what it looks like
05:35:43 <TheWhisper> on pttrns
05:36:15 <TheWhisper> hm
05:36:22 <TheWhisper> Or is the caret more of a 'press to go'
05:36:31 <medos> press
05:36:37 <medos> slider
05:36:40 <TheWhisper> What's the swipe one?
05:36:42 <TheWhisper> slider

06:12:12 <TheWhisper> "Tap
06:12:12 <TheWhisper> 	
06:12:12 <TheWhisper> ...(analogous to a single mouse click)."
06:12:14 <TheWhisper> lol
06:12:35 <medos> a tap
06:12:50 <medos> can turn into a touch and hold
06:13:00 <medos> can turn into a swipe
06:13:07 <medos> can turn into anything else
06:13:13 <medos> while a click
06:13:16 <medos> does one thing
06:13:21 <medos> it clicks
06:13:33 <medos> if you're on a button it presses that button
06:13:44 <medos> if you're not it doesn't
06:13:53 <medos> tl;dr: get an ios device
06:14:02 <TheWhisper> lol
06:16:00 <TheWhisper> okay
06:16:00 <TheWhisper> so
06:16:01 <TheWhisper> hm

06:16:36 <TheWhisper> i know
06:16:44 <TheWhisper> i wasn't blughing that
06:16:46 <medos> you're fucked if your teachers swipe a smartphone in your face
06:16:53 <medos> and you have no clue wtf they want from you
06:16:55 <medos> lelele

06:28:04 <medos> ipad
06:28:06 <medos> iphone
06:28:08 <medos> ipod?
06:29:19 <TheWhisper> 1.8
06:29:40 <TheWhisper> total guess
06:30:21 <medos> good
06:30:28 <TheWhisper> hm
06:30:29 <TheWhisper> oh wow
06:30:31 <TheWhisper> i was right
06:30:33 <TheWhisper> though now it's 2.2
06:30:34 <TheWhisper> cool
06:30:36 <medos> no
06:30:41 <medos> ios
06:30:47 <medos> osx = 2.2
06:30:50 <TheWhisper> yeah
06:30:52 <TheWhisper> just saw
06:30:53 <medos> ios = 1.8 - 2.2
06:31:02 <medos> depending on device
06:31:05 <TheWhisper> just read the rest of the article lol
06:31:28 <TheWhisper> hm
06:31:30 <TheWhisper> blah
06:31:39 <medos> you learned more today than
06:31:39 <TheWhisper> can you just tell me if what I have now is any better in your opinion
06:31:41 <TheWhisper> than previously
06:31:44 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/sCxlo.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/qJy8J.jpg
06:31:44 <medos> the past few
06:31:47 <TheWhisper> months ;)
06:31:54 <TheWhisper> lolol
06:33:00 <TheWhisper> also the menu is like a 
06:33:02 <TheWhisper> shelf thing
06:33:06 <TheWhisper> that pushes the content below it
06:34:00 <medos> it's dark mud
06:34:03 <medos> imo
06:34:08 <TheWhisper> oh yeah
06:34:09 <TheWhisper> not the colors
06:34:23 <TheWhisper> i haven't even really started on those yet :(
06:35:55 <TheWhisper> I wish I had like 2 more weeks
06:36:47 <TheWhisper> medos
06:36:54 <TheWhisper> disregarding the lack of color
06:36:56 <medos> ?whisper
06:37:05 <TheWhisper> wat?
06:37:13 <TheWhisper> I don't see the relevancy
06:37:25 <TheWhisper> anyway
06:37:28 <TheWhisper> disregarding the colors
06:37:32 <TheWhisper> or lack thereof
06:37:44 <TheWhisper> is it a good direction
06:37:46 <TheWhisper> ?
06:38:23 <medos> you said my name i said yours
06:38:27 <TheWhisper> oh
06:38:28 <TheWhisper> lol
06:38:31 <medos> you saw the video i said a week till i explain
06:38:37 <TheWhisper> ...
06:38:47 <TheWhisper> I don't have a week
06:38:53 <TheWhisper> for this thing
06:38:59 <TheWhisper> I don't want an explanation
06:39:01 <TheWhisper> just a siple
06:39:04 <TheWhisper> *simple
06:39:06 <TheWhisper> 'yes it's better
06:39:10 <TheWhisper> 'no it's not'
06:39:12 <TheWhisper> *'
06:39:53 <medos> direction is derived from how well i am able to separate content
06:40:02 <medos> content is separated with color and typography
06:40:11 <medos> and colors are killing the whole thing for me right now
06:40:15 <medos> as they did before
06:40:24 <TheWhisper> ;lkf'
06:40:35 <medos> imagine everything being roughly 10% darker on a mobile device
06:40:47 <medos> now if you consider that
06:40:51 <medos> it's muddy mud mud
06:42:06 <medos> https://vimeo.com/49744848
06:43:02 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/d7Tzq.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/bgj2k.jpg
06:43:06 <TheWhisper> i made it 60% brighter
06:43:11 <TheWhisper> now
06:43:14 <TheWhisper> disregarding the colors
06:43:36 <TheWhisper> lol
06:43:39 <medos> YAAAAAY
06:43:49 <TheWhisper> ?
06:44:56 <TheWhisper> was that to spiekermann
06:44:57 <TheWhisper> or me?
06:45:56 <medos> both
06:45:57 <medos> a little
06:46:31 <TheWhisper> lol
06:46:58 <TheWhisper> why did you just add those to dropbox
06:48:06 <medos> making it easier to solve tis
06:51:46 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAGmBRC1dc&feature=player_detailpage#t=158s
06:52:03 <medos> ^ this is still true
06:52:11 <medos> every ios device
06:52:30 <medos> opens the system integrated notification center
06:52:35 <medos> when you swipe top to bottom
06:52:41 <medos> you do not want to mimic
06:52:48 <medos> the notification center
06:53:23 <medos> e.g.: do not have a huge friggin dropdown coming from the top because that's easy to confuse with the notification swipe gesture
06:53:34 <medos> (top of device -> swipe down)
06:54:09 <medos> now you say you didn't know that
06:54:18 <medos> and i say i told you to get an ios device
06:54:31 <medos> because without one your direction will suck ;(
06:54:58 <TheWhisper> interesting
06:55:03 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTDRlswe93g
06:55:52 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-ABqwJDHsE&feature=player_detailpage#t=11s
06:55:56 <TheWhisper> blah
07:01:03 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9tHLx_P5Fw
07:01:13 <medos> what you CAN do is put a dropdown there
07:01:38 <medos> what you can (but should not) do is create an entire extra overlay
07:01:44 <medos> when pushing da button
07:02:19 <medos> swipe menu
07:02:29 <medos> not swipe content container swipe-out
07:02:54 <TheWhisper> hm
07:03:05 <medos> .gis tweetbot ipad
07:03:19 <TheWhisper> I see
07:03:26 <TheWhisper> the thing is
07:03:29 <TheWhisper> coming in from the side
07:03:37 <TheWhisper> doesn't really make sense for the site
07:03:46 <TheWhisper> hm
07:03:49 <TheWhisper> or maybe it does
07:03:55 <medos> i'm not arguing against your doings
07:04:03 <medos> i'm just explaining why I think they're not good
07:04:05 <TheWhisper> yeah
07:04:08 <medos> that's all
07:04:13 <TheWhisper> hm
07:04:27 <TheWhisper> i'm just super tired
07:04:35 <medos> has to be done tomorrow?
07:04:36 <medos> :p
07:04:53 <TheWhisper> it's obviously not going to be lol
07:05:04 <medos> but it has to?
07:05:11 <TheWhisper> well
07:05:14 <TheWhisper> the event
07:05:19 <TheWhisper> is oct 11-14
07:05:24 <TheWhisper> and the site goes live
07:05:24 <TheWhisper> at
07:05:26 <TheWhisper> the end of the event
07:05:27 <TheWhisper> i think
07:05:31 <TheWhisper> cuz what happens is like
07:05:35 <TheWhisper> the event starts
07:05:41 <TheWhisper> the photogs do their photos assignments
07:05:43 <TheWhisper> over those 3 days
07:05:47 <medos> i don't care wtf happens at the event
07:05:51 <TheWhisper> and then the last day they do a presentation or something
07:05:51 <medos> just get an ipad tomorrow
07:05:52 <TheWhisper> anyway
07:05:53 <TheWhisper> so
07:05:53 <medos> or ipod
07:05:54 <medos> or iphone
07:05:56 <medos> somewhere
07:06:03 <medos> rob a guy
07:06:04 <TheWhisper> the guys need to code the site
07:06:13 <TheWhisper> and then
07:06:14 <TheWhisper> so
07:06:17 <TheWhisper> yeah
07:06:33 <TheWhisper> i'll post on fb
07:06:46 <TheWhisper> "does anyone know someone who has an ipad/iphone i can mug?"
07:08:11 <EDSGD> Your room buddy.
07:08:23 <TheWhisper> one of my roommates has an iphone
07:08:26 <TheWhisper> but she was asleep
07:08:31 <TheWhisper> i knocked on her door really loudly
07:08:57 <EDSGD> goodnight.
07:10:24 <TheWhisper> Spiekermann keeps lapsing into german lol
07:10:34 <medos> .g psdwrangler
07:11:08 <medos> pls
07:11:47 <TheWhisper> hahha
07:11:51 <TheWhisper> he rages about formula 1
07:12:16 <TheWhisper> "i think formula 1 is totally stupid. having people racing around in plastic cars at 300 kph and burn fuel is the dumbest sport ever"
07:12:17 <TheWhisper> hahaha
07:12:30 <TheWhisper> also
07:12:32 <TheWhisper> what about that?
07:13:21 <TheWhisper> The only relevant thing in there that I see 
07:13:24 <TheWhisper> is the slider ui kit
07:13:27 <TheWhisper> which is not that relevant
07:14:02 <medos> ?looking
07:16:30 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/IYeYj.png
07:16:33 <medos> i'm serious
07:16:46 <TheWhisper> The about?
07:16:46 <medos> ;(
07:16:52 <TheWhisper> oh
07:16:59 <medos> you think a website is just a few color blocks
07:17:01 <medos> right now
07:17:25 <medos> if it doesn't "wow" you or piss you off you don't even notice it
07:17:47 <medos> subtle styling on everything
07:18:18 <ImALegend> it doesn't have to be that way though medos
07:18:20 <ImALegend> to be fair
07:18:31 <medos> it's extreme :P
07:18:44 <TheWhisper> http://subtraction.com/
07:19:01 <ImALegend> nice dog
07:19:38 <TheWhisper> yeah lol
07:19:41 <TheWhisper> love that photo
07:20:02 <medos> http://assets.subtraction.com/assets/site_sprite_new.png
07:20:41 <TheWhisper> http://theworldofphotographers.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/slim-aarons-8.jpg
07:20:54 <TheWhisper> yes
07:20:56 <TheWhisper> i see them
07:20:59 <TheWhisper> still just blocks of color
07:21:07 <medos> where are yours?
07:21:19 <TheWhisper> i don't have them :(
07:21:28 <medos> because that's a fucking skillfully executed website
07:21:40 <medos> i would not be able to do that :p
07:21:41 <TheWhisper> Yup
07:21:45 <TheWhisper> Khoi Vinh is a boss
07:21:59 <TheWhisper> also
07:22:02 <TheWhisper> can we just keep in mind
07:22:08 <TheWhisper> that yes these are all important things for websites
07:22:14 <TheWhisper> but this specific site
07:22:23 <TheWhisper> does not have time for all that
07:22:24 <TheWhisper> :(
07:22:28 <TheWhisper> or at least
07:22:31 <TheWhisper> not to begin with
07:22:54 <medos> i threw so much data at you
07:23:12 <medos> why would you grasp this in a day? D:
07:23:55 <TheWhisper> exactly
07:23:57 <TheWhisper> that's my point
07:24:01 <TheWhisper> well
07:24:10 <TheWhisper> it's that yes, I do grasp the concepts
07:24:20 <TheWhisper> but I don't have the time to apply them fully to this specific project
07:24:29 <TheWhisper> though i will explore them in da futura
07:30:32 <medos> yup
07:31:23 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/EBhCd.png
07:31:30 <medos> there's more to this than just blocks of color
07:32:36 <medos> his typography and linework is easily comparable with the complexety of those buttons
07:33:16 <medos> tried to mark different fonts/colors/dividers
07:34:16 <TheWhisper> oh well yeah
07:34:19 <TheWhisper> of course
07:34:55 <TheWhisper> You were just talking about color originally though lol
07:35:19 <medos> if you pick one typeface for the entire site
07:36:29 <medos> and then give me an example for color block simple website with 20 typeface colors sizes and styles
07:36:31 <medos> that's no fair
07:36:32 <medos> :p
07:38:25 <TheWhisper> lol
07:39:12 <TheWhisper> okay i'm not getting jack done right now
07:39:16 <TheWhisper> may as well go to sleep
07:40:24 <medos> w8
07:42:28 <TheWhisper> ?
07:43:30 <medos> exporting something
07:44:17 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/TFW_Site_v15name.jpg
07:44:38 <medos> granted, the colors might not be the best
07:44:42 <medos> but it's far from flashy
07:45:04 <medos> you also said you liked windows 8 new minimalism
07:45:17 <medos> but you never really considered that they have widely different colors per box
07:46:12 <TheWhisper> hm
07:46:34 <medos> btw.: i have no clue where the content should go
07:46:42 <medos> that's just a visual separation of your muddy mud
07:46:54 <TheWhisper> lol it looks like the guy is pushing the overlay thing
07:47:12 <TheWhisper> also
07:47:25 <TheWhisper> the content could go similarly to how i have it vertically
07:47:27 <TheWhisper> just from the side
07:47:29 <TheWhisper> is
07:47:30 <TheWhisper> *ish
07:47:57 <medos> that's your problem
07:48:16 <medos> my problem was your problem with presenting boxes that actually look like boxes
07:48:18 <medos> and not mud
07:48:53 <TheWhisper> yeah
07:48:54 <TheWhisper> thanks 
07:49:05 <TheWhisper> i have some good ideas now
07:49:12 <TheWhisper> or at least my tired brain thinks so
07:49:25 <medos> do not
07:49:26 <medos> add
07:49:26 <medos> more
07:49:27 <medos> color
07:49:39 <TheWhisper> lol
07:49:41 <TheWhisper> i won't
07:49:50 <TheWhisper> do you honestly think someone would do that?
07:49:56 <TheWhisper> just go on a mockup and add more color?
07:50:19 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/EOMjq.png
07:50:20 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/g3N87.png
07:50:27 <medos> no
07:50:31 <medos> you use black or white shapes
07:50:32 <medos> and soft light
07:50:37 <medos> or normal and low opacity
07:50:49 <medos> feel free to change the colors
07:50:50 <TheWhisper> interesting
07:50:50 <TheWhisper> so
07:50:52 <TheWhisper> different
07:50:52 <medos> but do not add more
07:50:54 <TheWhisper> shades
07:51:00 <TheWhisper> and whatever
07:51:03 <TheWhisper> else it's called
07:51:23 <TheWhisper> different darkness/brightnesses
07:52:15 <TheWhisper> well

15:52:11 <EDSGD> Anyway, how's it going?
15:52:15 <marshmallow> oh hai, i had questionss
15:52:24 <marshmallow> so, I'm working on a logo for a friend
15:52:30 <marshmallow> and he uses chinese in his logo
15:52:33 <medos> EDSGD good :) just woke up
15:52:44 <medos> chi-nese
15:52:55 <EDSGD> Same here. Having my cup of joe now.
15:52:58 <EDSGD> xD
15:53:09 <medos> what's with chinese?
15:53:12 <EDSGD> Where's your friend from?
15:53:53 <marshmallow> sorry, got distracted wiht a phone call
15:53:59 <medos> where's my octopus?
15:54:01 <EDSGD> Also, whizpah's name is Dan?
15:54:02 <marshmallow> anyway, so yar..  his logo uses chinese
15:54:10 <EDSGD> Why?
15:54:13 <marshmallow> is there fonts that i can use to stylize the chinese?
15:54:20 <marshmallow> not fonts that pretend to be chinese
15:54:39 <EDSGD> .google chinese font
15:54:51 <medos> noooooo
15:55:09 <EDSGD> THIS: http://www.dafont.com/chinese-takeaway.font
15:55:29 <medos> that's how horrible tattoos are born
15:55:31 <marshmallow> 傑作 <-- this
15:55:39 <marshmallow> is what i want in different fonts
15:56:07 <marshmallow> not words that look like chinese
15:56:15 <marshmallow> or fonts that pretend to be chinese
15:56:20 <medos> ♓
15:56:25 <medos> ♉
15:56:31 <marshmallow> ?

15:56:39 <medos> :P
15:56:41 <medos> uhm
15:56:44 <medos> lemme wake up
15:56:57 <medos> TheWhisper strained my question-answering-ability
15:57:12 <marshmallow> the deal is, i give him logo.  he gives me slightly used camera equipment.
15:57:15 <marshmallow> not bad
15:57:26 <EDSGD> LOL
15:58:04 <medos> so if he don't like logo you get no camra eqwipmend
15:58:22 <medos> ✌
15:58:42 <marshmallow> =(
15:58:44 <medos> ☬ <- lol
15:58:57 <marshmallow> i think he's gonna give it to me anyway
15:59:01 <marshmallow> he bought a new camera
15:59:03 <medos> ☺
15:59:03 <marshmallow> anyway
15:59:06 <medos> yeah
15:59:12 <medos> let me wake up and organize my thoughts
15:59:17 <marshmallow> i don't think what he's giving me is compatible with his new camera
15:59:22 <medos> then look for the logs where some guy was in here
15:59:23 <marshmallow> *i think what he's
15:59:45 <medos> who wanted to invent new fonts for his cayman island language
16:00:10 <EDSGD> I <3 this song even though I have no clue as to what he's saying. http://open.spotify.com/track/3hyeC3q227ZVAm1H5aR9Wn :D

16:07:17 <medos> ok so
16:07:26 <medos> marshmallow remember a guy named Klevre?
16:07:31 <medos> or klever or some shizzle
16:07:33 <medos> who was in here
16:08:05 <marshmallow> nope
16:08:17 <medos> good
16:08:58 <medos> he's living on the maldives
16:09:05 <medos> and maldives have their own language
16:09:07 <medos> and font
16:09:16 <medos> and they have like 5 fonts for their computers
16:09:51 <medos> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaana
16:10:11 <EDSGD> Interesting.
16:10:52 <marshmallow> ooh

16:10:56 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/12-07/letters-5weights.png
16:11:00 <medos> now he wanted to make more fonts
16:11:03 <medos> like thin and fat
16:11:36 -!- Carson [~carson@enat-152010252060.appstate.edu] has joined ##reddit-gd
16:11:54 <medos> tl;dr: he said "yeah none of those modifications is readable"
16:12:03 <medos> so whatever you do to chinese text
16:12:13 <medos> you might fuck up if you don't stick to an exact font you have somewhere
16:12:37 <medos> most modding i would do if i were youuuu
16:12:39 <medos> would be
16:13:23 <medos> no idea tbh. just stick to a font you have on your system that has chinese characters
16:14:00 <medos> that png shows 3. being the regular font
16:14:20 <medos> 1, 2, 4, 5 was me making it thinner and fatter in a very simplified manner
16:14:24 <TheWhisper> medos you can delete all the site files on dropbox
16:14:27 <TheWhisper> i copied them over
16:14:37 <medos> (without knowing the language)
16:14:45 <medos> TheWhisper EDSGD wanted to see
16:14:53 <TheWhisper> lol
16:15:03 <EDSGD> I saw.
16:15:45 <medos> that was the before

16:18:12 <medos> ᴈDSGD
16:18:47 <medos> marshmallow before you go funky you might make a post in r/favors maybe?
16:19:16 <medos> "someone tell me how (and if at all) i could modify these chinese characters for a friend's logo without losing the meaning"
16:19:26 <medos> if you add "teheeee ^_____^"
16:19:31 <marshmallow> lol
16:19:35 <medos> you'll get answers
16:19:38 <medos> i'm sure of it
16:19:49 <marshmallow> aight

16:28:48 <EDSGD> It certainly made it easier to navigate through it.
16:29:53 <medos> i used teamviewer on my ipod once

18:55:18 <medos> .y flipboard
18:55:24 <zakmac> Guy at my old job showed me and I was impressed
18:55:33 <zakmac> Yes
18:55:46 <medos> it works well for mobile
18:55:58 <medos> i would never really look for news at my pc
18:56:49 <medos> except for occasional reddit browsing
18:57:20 <medos> case in point: TheWhisper
18:57:22 <medos> :P
18:59:08 <zakmac> I use Reeder for PC browsing
18:59:33 <zakmac> But only rarely. I usually just pop on Al Jazeera once a week and get angry then stop reading because the world is a dickhead
19:00:23 <medos> yup
19:02:22 <medos> for iphone there's feedly and pulse
19:02:35 <medos> but they're nowhere near as good as flipboard
19:04:04 <medos> if you have a mouse in your hand, a screen big enough to show photoshop menus why not just do some stuff instead of hunting down news
19:04:51 <EDSGD> Who was this directed to? Me?
19:06:20 <medos> no
19:06:36 <medos> it was directed at me :p
19:06:44 <EDSGD> Me ok.
19:07:08 <medos> i just explained why i don't really like looking at news
19:10:49 <medos> if you get bored tutoring you can flipboard for a minute and read the articles that you thought were valuable when you get home
19:10:56 <medos> or when they leave
19:10:59 <medos> no idea where you tutor
19:11:01 <medos> ;)
19:23:41 <medos> EDSGD
19:24:00 <EDSGD> Yes.

19:35:37 <medos> interesting
19:36:45 <marshmallow> http://dribbble.com/shots/289349-Where-1-1-3-concept-wedding-photography-logo
19:39:14 <medos> what's with you
19:39:20 <medos> didn't you say you disliked weddings?
19:39:26 <medos> or am i mixing stuff up? :P
19:49:03 <EDSGD> I love cheese.
19:49:10 <EDSGD> Why is cheese to good? <3
19:49:15 <EDSGD> *so
19:50:16 <medos> now i'm hungry :(
19:50:23 <medos> EDSGD you should definitely give feedly a try
19:51:36 <EDSGD> i will
19:51:48 <EDSGD> i bookmarkec when you linked it
19:52:10 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/vbP6a.png
19:52:22 <medos> would be best to use a separate browser for it
19:52:26 <medos> .g chrome canary
19:52:48 <EDSGD> mericuh
19:52:50 <EDSGD> mang
19:53:22 <EDSGD> how can people jail you for sending naughty texts accidently
19:53:48 <medos> i didn't even notice that article
19:53:54 <medos> it was more an example of how feedly looks
19:55:50 <medos> http://www.feedly.com/home#subscription/feed/http://www.reddit.com/.rss
19:56:56 <EDSGD> Yeah looks cool.
19:57:07 <EDSGD> Will be innstalling it in a while.
19:57:12 <EDSGD> Flibboard is awesome
19:57:42 <medos> if you combine it with pocket or readability
19:57:43 <medos> yeah
19:57:49 <EDSGD> Maybe I moticed it since I'm constantly thinking about it ;d\
19:59:11 <medos> marshmallow show wip ;)
19:59:28 <marshmallow> wip?
19:59:33 <marshmallow> work in progress?
19:59:57 <medos> yeah
19:59:59 <marshmallow> <medos> didn't you say you disliked weddings? <-- no, I didn't say that
20:00:18 <medos> you probably just disliked the photography-stress aspect then
20:00:36 <medos> also: you can't deny me a purse drawing and demand a logo
20:00:39 <medos> :P
20:00:42 <medos> sorry gal
20:01:47 <marshmallow> oh boo
20:03:16 <marshmallow> http://minus.com/lbuLRPubdjrPep
20:03:26 <marshmallow> not liking em at all
20:03:28 * marshmallow shrugs
20:04:30 <zakmac> #2 isn't bad but why is the P in the camera not round?
20:04:37 <zakmac> Kills the illusion

20:07:12 <MrLime> Hey all!
20:07:33 <medos> marshmallow wouldn't it be possible to make a lense circle outline (very simple) with his japanese name in the center and his name below?
20:07:45 <medos> or just the *chinese text with his name below it
20:07:49 <medos> and photography or something
20:08:08 <marshmallow> could
20:08:13 <marshmallow> idk
20:08:31 <marshmallow> clearly today is a bad day for me to design.  lol
20:09:10 <marshmallow> the last one is a play on a P & Y (y is upside down) to form a camera
20:09:11 <marshmallow> ish
20:09:16 <marshmallow> lawls, looks funny XD
20:09:18 <medos> circles are so common in asian stuff
20:09:38 <medos> calligraphi and so on
20:09:42 <medos> *calligraphy

20:10:27 <medos> just saying though
20:10:55 <marshmallow> i like that zakmac
20:10:59 <marshmallow> i'll fix that first
20:11:02 <marshmallow> then try circles
20:11:30 <medos> be careful with circles though
20:11:46 <medos> i'd google for definitions and meanings of circles in asian culture first :p
20:11:52 <medos> offending is easy
20:12:13 <zakmac> You give my famiry great shame
20:12:40 <medos> go work in a railroadrestaurant
20:13:33 <zakmac> Too busy eating delicious red curry to do anything else

20:13:53 <zakmac> ./mode ##reddit-gd +tolerance
20:14:39 <MrLime> Going good. Not had much time to update it myself but we've got some writers. I've just started a new full time job so my spare time is limited 
20:14:52 <medos> Sounds good. :)
20:15:26 <medos> Fulltime printstuff?
20:15:38 <MrLime> yeah 
20:15:55 <medos> neat
20:16:02 <zakmac> Oh man, so I pretty obviously get in phases of my designs matching :-\

20:16:47 <medos> why would those bars turn red
20:17:01 <medos> is content and hd space going to boil?
20:17:03 <zakmac> Using the same font on both doesn't help
20:17:06 <MrLime> yeah. it's a huge job and it takes me an hour or so to get there. 
20:17:23 <medos> awwww shit
20:17:29 <medos> an hour D:
20:17:38 <MrLime> yeah. 
20:17:49 <medos> driving yourself or public transportation?
20:17:51 <MrLime> But it's a job in the industry so I'm happy with it 
20:17:57 <MrLime> public transport 
20:18:01 <medos> let's hope you did not sell the ipad yet then
20:18:33 <MrLime> I did but I don't need to pay for transport anyway so that's handy 
20:19:00 <medos> awesome
20:19:39 <MrLime> I actually got the new iphone last friday when it came out. I sold the ipad on thursday.
20:19:51 <medos> is letterboxing annoyyyyyyyying?
20:19:59 <MrLime> very
20:20:06 <medos> because my app thingie is not yet iphone 5 screen ready
20:20:08 <medos> D:
20:20:11 <medos> oh dear
20:21:01 <medos> will just takea few months till that's fixed for me
20:21:25 <medos> i'll be back in a bit, kinda hungry ;)
20:21:30 <medos> ?challenge
20:21:40 <medos> feel free to participate (deadline is whenever)
20:22:13 <MrLime> Before you go. Well done on your first dribbble shot 
20:23:25 <medos> thank you! :)
20:23:48 <MrLime> the app designer community is huge there 
20:25:01 <medos> yeah
20:25:21 <medos> a bit silly because lots of icons/interfaces are just for fun
20:25:34 <medos> "hey i made a button"
20:26:06 <MrLime> you're killing it. Looking forward to what you have in store for your next shot :)
20:26:52 <medos> i'll try to keep it to stuff that will be used somewhere ;)
20:27:34 <marshmallow> yo, ya know what's funny about this logo thingy I'm making?
20:27:37 <medos> you shouldn't have a problem either though, dribbble loves closeups of print design just as much
20:27:44 <marshmallow> technically, the chinese should be up & down.  not left & right XD
20:28:55 <marshmallow> ooooooooooh!  傑作 means masterpiece
20:28:58 <marshmallow> coolios!
20:29:19 <marshmallow> i assumed it was his name -.-

20:34:09 <medos> i eat what i can swallow
20:35:33 <medos> i have 5 educated german typographers
20:35:42 <medos> following them on twitter
20:35:48 <medos> gives me world news that are actually relevant
20:35:54 <medos> they're not going to teweet some bullshit
20:36:00 <medos> but rather valuable educating news
20:36:02 <TheWhisper> links?
20:36:03 <medos> if any at all
20:36:05 <TheWhisper> and I see
20:36:06 <medos> are you german?

20:51:49 <Carson> the whole industrial design vs. fine arts

20:55:30 <medos> it's due monday
20:56:07 <Carson> no
20:56:17 <Carson> it's due week after next 
20:56:33 <Carson> but I need to get it done early because I have other things to do 
20:56:42 <Carson> i have to do a presentation on it next Thursday 
20:56:47 <Carson> just started to write now 
20:56:56 <Carson> trying to figure out my main structure 
20:57:04 <Carson> but I'll probably just end up ranting illogically 
20:57:17 <medos> sounds good to me
20:57:52 <Carson> do you know of Marcel Duchamp's Fountain?
20:58:06 <Carson> do you think that relates at all?
20:58:54 <Carson> enough to include it

21:30:51 <medos> throwing stuff from illustrator to photoshop to make it look a lil' better

21:31:53 <Carson> maybe

21:34:16 <medos> that's what i've been trying to find out for years

21:35:19 <medos> v. good
21:36:07 <Carson> origin from this website 
21:36:08 <Carson> http://www.ashersarlin.com/
21:38:36 <medos> you could make your paper say:
21:38:50 <medos> industrial designers progressed too fast with technology
21:39:05 <medos> because many an arist can display his work to distract me from writing it
21:39:08 <medos> the end

21:44:34 <TheWhisper> linkedin redesigned themselves
21:51:33 <TheWhisper> Hm
21:51:48 <medos> see
21:52:03 <medos> it's the news
21:52:17 <TheWhisper> ha
21:52:26 <TheWhisper> I was just about to comment on that guy who killed himself on fox news
21:52:34 <TheWhisper> and then fox news was like 'get off it we're gonna get fined!'
21:52:55 <medos> ha
21:52:56 <TheWhisper> well maybe if you weren't showing some live video of some random dude being chased by the police in an open field
21:53:12 <TheWhisper> like he was an animal in a zoo with everyone pressed up to the glass watching
21:53:16 <TheWhisper> then you wouldn't have this problem
21:54:04 <TheWhisper> ugh
21:54:21 <TheWhisper> The fact that 1) the guy running in the field from the cops was newsworthy enough to show live video from 
21:54:25 <TheWhisper> pisses me off
21:54:26 <TheWhisper> BUT
21:54:28 <TheWhisper> on the other side
21:54:47 <TheWhisper> the fact that they're all 'sorry for showing you what real life is like folks!'
21:54:51 <TheWhisper> pisses me off too
21:54:53 <TheWhisper> and then 
21:54:56 <TheWhisper> when he was driving in his car
21:54:59 <TheWhisper> that was live
21:55:00 <TheWhisper> no delay
21:55:03 <TheWhisper> but then when he got out
21:55:08 <TheWhisper> apparently that was on delay?
21:55:12 <TheWhisper> (sounds like bs)
21:55:15 <TheWhisper> but even if that were true
21:55:21 <TheWhisper> it's okay to show him crash and die a fiery death
21:55:36 <TheWhisper> but having him pull a gun to his head in a zoomed out grainy image and pull the trigger is not okay?
21:55:38 <TheWhisper> fuck that shit
21:55:52 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=824fK1pkGT8 lol
21:55:59 <TheWhisper> not the shooting
21:56:00 <TheWhisper> just his apology
21:56:29 <TheWhisper> "yeah it was on delay but something went wrong. we won't say what went wrong, but something went wrong. probably the fact that we didn't actually put it on delay"

22:16:33 <Carson> hi
22:20:33 <medos> hi car
22:21:15 <TheWhisper> medos what
22:21:17 <TheWhisper> why
22:22:17 <medos> yesterday you were like "boo hoo this shit has to be done stat and i have no clue how ipad layouting works"
22:22:28 <TheWhisper> ?
22:22:33 <TheWhisper> oh I meant the font folder
22:22:34 <TheWhisper> lol
22:22:35 <medos> today you're "awwww yea police shoting bill 3083 police brutality"
22:22:38 <medos> then i think
22:22:42 <medos> you don't really care
22:22:48 <medos> so why have a shared folder in the first place
22:23:00 <TheWhisper> :(
22:23:02 <medos> if all you do is entertain yourself with mainstream media
22:23:04 <TheWhisper> Lol
22:23:20 <TheWhisper> How long did I work on that yesterday
22:23:21 <TheWhisper> from like
22:23:25 <TheWhisper>  4 pm
22:23:26 <TheWhisper> to 4 am
22:23:28 <TheWhisper> 12 hours
22:23:44 <TheWhisper> that's
22:24:00 <medos> a fraction of the time you could've spent
22:24:07 <medos> overall
22:24:08 <TheWhisper> 2% of my time
22:24:14 <TheWhisper> spent watching news
22:24:52 <TheWhisper> or
22:24:58 <Carson> hmm
22:24:59 <TheWhisper> 1:50
22:25:01 <TheWhisper> ratio
22:25:10 <medos> why explain yourself
22:25:29 <medos> i know the next thing you design is going to be caused by an authority telling you to
22:25:31 <medos> ;)
22:25:35 <medos> i'm not mad i just don't care anymore
22:27:02 <zakmac> Do you lot get any work done? Every time I check in here there's more chatter boxing happening
22:27:26 <medos> yes
22:27:35 <TheWhisper> yes
22:29:15 <TheWhisper> oh cool
22:29:24 <TheWhisper> pdf of logos for the magazine i'm working on
22:29:54 <TheWhisper> wow
22:29:56 <TheWhisper> they all suck
22:30:13 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/e8GWf.png what is this crapola
22:30:49 <medos> ?strokes
22:30:51 <medos> ?stroke
22:30:54 <medos> herpaderp
22:31:33 <TheWhisper> Are you having one?
22:31:34 <TheWhisper> lol
22:31:45 <TheWhisper> I don't see why they'd want to change it
22:32:04 <TheWhisper> Is what we have now: http://i.imgur.com/A3TFp.png
22:32:10 <TheWhisper> and it's not super amazing
22:32:15 <TheWhisper> but it's a lot better than those other ones
22:39:46 <zakmac> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7763442/iphone%20tracing.ai
22:39:58 <zakmac> No idea why, but if anyone wants iPhone 4 line art
22:41:37 <medos> let's swap
22:41:38 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobefiles/iPhoneWireFrame-OCD-011.ai
22:42:21 <zakmac> How is this 2.4mb
22:42:24 <zakmac> What have you done?
22:42:27 <medos> enjoy
22:42:40 <medos> ignore 2-3 files i forgot to embed
22:42:57 <medos> check layers and artboards and symbol panel
22:43:22 <medos> and exchange the missing helveticas for your mac helvetica
22:43:25 <medos> i didn't do that just now
22:44:19 <zakmac> Spiffy
22:44:50 <medos> export
22:44:52 <medos> -> png
22:44:55 <medos> use artboards
22:45:07 <medos> should (in theory) export every ui element
22:45:18 <medos> didn't really work on it any further than that
22:45:30 <medos> there's no automation for layer visibility obviously
22:47:38 <medos> fun part is where exporting at 200% gives retina assets
22:48:25 <medos> i have to admit though: the phone shape is not mine
22:48:30 <medos> feel free to place yours in there
22:49:30 <zakmac> Phone shape is… off
22:49:42 <medos> the one in there?
22:49:47 <zakmac> Yeah
22:49:53 <zakmac> Its a very lumpy 3g
22:49:57 <medos> yup
22:49:59 <medos> irrelevant
22:50:03 <medos> if you look at the rulers
22:50:12 <medos> you see that the whole thing starts at 0,0 with the interface
22:50:27 <medos> the lumpy 3g was just placed as a dummy
22:51:25 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/pkJq7.png
22:51:51 <zakmac> Unrelated - "Why revising my work is important -it sucks dick at v1, always."
22:53:38 <medos> if i were to finish that template file it would need ipad , iphone 5, all glyphish icons, new interface default gloss / effects
22:53:44 <medos> so i will leave it at v11
22:54:08 <medos> oh
22:54:11 <medos> revising
22:54:14 <medos> mh
22:55:21 <zakmac> This is damn extensive
23:07:22 <TheWhisper> lol

23:18:19 <zakmac> You design this?
23:18:42 <zakmac> Without looking too carefully, I like it
23:18:57 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobefiles/scalewhoa.ai
23:19:03 <medos> well it's glyphishicons
23:19:06 <medos> i think
23:19:13 <medos> + colors + lines + stuff
23:20:06 <medos> not sure if it even looks right for you, it should require din
23:24:43 <medos> any complaints will be ignored, having the .ai file means you can fix it yourself :P
