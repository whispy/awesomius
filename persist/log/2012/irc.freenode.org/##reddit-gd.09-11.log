02:09:52 <TheWhisper> "I think something most people are missing about this comic is the alt text. the thing about ADD or ADHD is that it's inherently an issue of risk evaluation. in essence the portion of your brain that judges risk is still working fine and the portion that judges reward is working as well but the portion that turns the risk evaluation into the ability not to do something (the prefrontal cortex) doesn't work. basically you can see the wall
02:09:52 <TheWhisper>  coming but you have no brakes. what this means is that you're a lot more likely to do something because its pleasurable rather than to reduce pain. so to bring the alt text back into it Randall ended up picking the KSP balloon because its fun. someone with ADD/ADHD will often pick the fun bits despite the future consequences. for instance i spent all last night watching the fourth season of dexter despite knowing full well i had calcul
02:09:52 <TheWhisper> us to do. were i on my meds i would have easily chosen calculus first because i would have been able to delay my reward until the prospect of risk was gone."
02:09:53 <TheWhisper> yay
02:10:02 <TheWhisper> that's like my liiife
02:10:12 <TheWhisper> also, i was wondering why i couldn't get any work done toda

05:46:45 <CottonBalls> Given that most of the people on there use templates and rip off others.
05:47:14 <CottonBalls> The whole think is just awful.

05:58:57 <Kocho> happy to help 
05:58:58 <Kocho> :D
05:59:01 <medos> lol
05:59:41 <medos> i'm open minded, right now i feel like my kind of door-opening feels less weirdo
05:59:56 <medos> but then again i might be subjectively judging
06:00:14 <Kocho> you'll see my app icon
06:00:17 <Kocho> and be like
06:00:22 <Kocho> wtf is he doing this time?
06:00:31 <medos> lol
06:01:22 <medos> i made a tutorial yesterday!

06:02:07 <medos> i really only grabbed the final png image of that tut and added shit to it
06:02:09 <medos> lol
06:02:12 <Kocho> thats not your tutorial
06:02:15 <Kocho> oh
06:02:16 <Kocho> lol

06:02:30 <Kocho> why the mac screen?
06:02:38 <Kocho> and those aren't your arrows
06:03:08 <Kocho> wait
06:03:14 <Kocho> you MADE it or you DID it?

06:06:52 <Kocho> i think it's 25 medos

06:09:10 <medos> BIG TIME

06:10:15 <medos> error
06:10:30 <medos> Kocho
06:10:37 <Kocho> yep?
06:11:15 <medos> you can pin websites to the homescreen, when said website is a 512x512 png you can check if your template or approach is right (it'll add the default gloss but sometimes it still helps)
06:11:16 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobe-ai.png
06:11:22 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobe-psd.png
06:11:38 <medos> i made this to check if either of my templates is off
06:11:57 <Kocho> wait
06:12:07 <Kocho> so i make a website with a 512 x512 png as the page?
06:12:12 <Kocho> and then i can preview it?
06:12:30 <medos> first one was the one you used (and i used a little) the second one is the appicontemplate.com one
06:12:32 <medos> uuuuuhm
06:12:46 <Kocho> nvm i cbf testing it
06:12:48 <medos> http://www.theryanford.com/new/icon_fry/
06:12:49 <Kocho> he'll upload it
06:13:16 <Kocho> ryan ford's stuff is great
06:13:20 <medos> <link rel="apple-touch-icon-precomposed" href="apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png">
06:13:22 <Kocho> he's one of my favs
06:13:32 <Kocho> yeah don't worry medos, its ok
06:13:44 <medos> i never did that myself :P
06:13:52 <medos> but you can really just take a 512x512 png
06:13:59 <medos> and homescreen that
06:14:06 <medos> it'll add the default gloss though
06:14:25 <medos> you shouldn't have trouble with liveview
06:14:42 <medos> being available ;)
06:14:43 <Kocho> yeah
06:14:47 <Kocho> ill use that
06:14:52 <Kocho> it gives me a good idea
06:15:32 <medos> scaling doesn't even matter as much, if the @2x one looks right on your screen it will look fine on ios
06:15:42 <medos> just the colors can fuck up horribly
06:15:57 <medos> the problem i had with the first few icon approaches ;)
06:16:12 <medos> darn you gammaaaaaah
06:16:57 <Kocho> the icon has been the worst part
06:17:01 <Kocho> of making an app
06:17:04 <Kocho> its just stupid
06:17:19 <Kocho> even the rgb's were better
06:18:45 <Kocho> medos: http://ckgd.net/MISC/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-11%20at%204.16.33%20PM.png
06:19:05 <medos> oh wow
06:19:15 <medos> that's quite some perspective
06:19:25 <Kocho> :(
06:19:31 <medos> nah, in a good way
06:19:35 <Kocho> oh good
06:19:44 <medos> the lighting/reflection stuff on the metal base looks sick
06:19:56 <Kocho> cool
06:20:08 <Kocho> do you remember the current one?
06:20:16 <Kocho> ill upload it anyway
06:20:18 <medos> but i feel like it gets too dark due to the gaps D:
06:20:38 <medos> yup i do remember it being a red button w/o perspective and attention sign on it
06:20:58 <medos> w/o tilt
06:20:59 <medos> rather
06:21:01 <Kocho> yeah
06:21:04 <Kocho> you're right
06:21:09 <Kocho> i still like that one better
06:21:20 <medos> the current one you mean?
06:21:31 <medos> the one you just linked
06:21:33 <medos> *
06:21:34 <medos> lol
06:21:40 <Kocho> no
06:21:43 <Kocho> i like this one: http://ckgd.net/MISC/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-11%20at%204.20.53%20PM.png
06:21:45 <Kocho> better
06:21:53 <Kocho> (current)
06:22:00 <medos> ohh
06:22:13 <Kocho> but i think it's because its more my style
06:22:19 <medos> true
06:22:24 <Kocho> the new one looks a bit more gamey which is the whole point
06:22:36 <medos> the metal on that one looks a little bit cheap
06:22:39 <medos> e.g. plastic
06:22:43 <Kocho> o
06:22:44 <Kocho> k
06:22:50 <medos> but that's not neccessarily a bad thing
06:22:52 <medos> unlessssss
06:23:06 <medos> the home screen bg is dark
06:23:15 <Kocho> have i shown you a GUI?
06:23:37 <medos> last time you showed it it looked awesome already
06:23:43 <Kocho> 1 sec
06:23:50 <medos> except for a few little missing things
06:24:06 <Kocho> http://ckgd.net/MISC/gui.png
06:24:13 <Kocho> thats an example of one of the screens
06:24:39 <Kocho> its still a work in progress though, but I'm pretty confident it'll look similar
06:24:48 <medos> yeah
06:25:57 <medos> for some reason
06:26:06 <medos> (probably the stroke on the inner shape)
06:26:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Nlgmf.png
06:26:11 <medos> it feels off center to me
06:26:48 <Kocho> hrmm
06:26:53 <Kocho> ill check it out
06:26:53 <medos> that's not really important though, motion and button pushing
06:27:01 <medos> the whole thing will barely be noticeable
06:27:09 <medos> for people like me
06:27:16 <medos> so anyone else will not give a fuck
06:27:17 <medos> lol
06:27:20 <Kocho> lol
06:27:33 <Kocho> i know what you mean, ill have a look
06:27:56 <medos> other than that: pretty awesome progress
06:28:01 <Kocho> thanks :)
06:30:15 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/mn1FP.png
06:31:29 <Kocho> does imgur load really slowly for you?
06:31:32 <medos> hmmmm, with a lot of work merging the three buttons into one and giving them a smaller metal base
06:31:34 <Kocho> the images i mean
06:31:43 <medos> i'd like the tilted one more
06:31:53 <medos> but as it is the last one you linked is better
06:31:59 <medos> oh
06:32:03 <medos> that happens sometimes
06:32:17 <medos> mainly when people start work somewhere (8pm in europe as it is now)
06:32:25 <Kocho> ahh ok
06:32:31 <Kocho> i reckon with fridge pal
06:32:47 <Kocho> the drop shadow on the handle could be 10% - 20% darker
06:32:56 <Kocho> and i think you need to add a face to the handle
06:33:08 <medos> drop shadow is darker already
06:33:13 <medos> will be updated next version
06:33:15 <medos> hmmm
06:33:30 <medos> TheWhisper sent me an email with a collection of improvement stuff
06:33:35 <medos> i have not yet looked at it
06:33:50 <medos> but i'll probably make a notes list
06:34:17 <Kocho> ahttp://i.imgur.com/yP1eS.png
06:34:19 <Kocho> http://i.imgur.com/yP1eS.png
06:34:27 <Kocho> like that part should be a bit of shadow
06:34:28 <medos> i'm happier with the handle being a bright blob right now than having it be a black/grey dot
06:34:39 <medos> oh
06:34:40 <medos> ON
06:34:42 <medos> the handle
06:34:48 <medos> okey
06:35:07 <Kocho> just so the left of it looks like a rounded surface
06:35:15 <Kocho> left of where i've done the path*
06:35:44 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/18Z60.png
06:35:50 <medos> ^ current status
06:35:59 <medos> i'll work on it as soon as more content is done
06:36:05 <Kocho> the bottom ones like 50 spot
06:36:08 <Kocho> you've redone that?
06:36:13 <Kocho> or just scaled?
06:36:28 <medos> it's various shadows and shadings in the psd
06:36:36 <medos> and i activate deactivate
06:36:37 <medos> adjust
06:36:41 <medos> save new versions
06:36:44 <Kocho> pixel nudge?
06:36:56 <medos> NO! D:
06:37:05 <Kocho> they look very sharp
06:37:11 <Kocho> i mean that in a good way
06:38:54 <medos> the shadow?
06:39:11 <medos> eh
06:39:12 <medos> wait
06:39:49 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/App%20Icon%20-%2013.png <- in the build that was sent to apple
06:39:57 <Kocho> no i mean the whole thing
06:40:30 <Kocho> 1337 ratings
06:40:30 <Kocho> lol
06:40:40 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/App%20Icon%20-%2014.png <- current look which looks better to me on my laptop screen
06:40:59 <medos> no idea if it's good for smaller sizes
06:41:00 <Kocho> yeah i agree
06:41:05 <Kocho> especially at smaller sizes
06:41:26 <medos> because 29x29px might merge the strong shadow with the handle
06:41:32 <medos> but right now that seems to be a good thing
06:42:34 <medos> by the way: when i color all the icons you'll definitely have beta access
06:42:50 <medos> and will need to give feedback once update :P
06:42:58 <Kocho> ugh
06:43:00 <Kocho> why me?
06:43:05 <Kocho> :D
06:43:26 <medos> you're as picky as TheWhisper
06:43:32 <medos> but TheWhisper just has a blackberry
06:43:50 <Kocho> pfft
06:43:53 <medos> so your ios device makes you 5% cooler
06:43:54 <medos> haha
06:43:55 <Kocho> get with the times
06:43:56 <Kocho> yeah
06:43:57 <Kocho> lol
06:44:34 <medos> i'm still wondering if all assets are in the app
06:45:12 <medos> 10mb png , testbuilds were 6.4 mb
06:45:19 <medos> *10mb of pngs
06:45:32 <medos> not sure if xcode is that good at compression
06:46:02 <Kocho> i need to find someone in india who'll code my app for me
06:46:10 <medos> lol
06:46:11 <Kocho> i want to make one :(
06:46:21 <medos> i was about to link an article about that
06:46:28 <medos> actually a few articles
06:46:28 <medos> http://muledesign.com/2012/09/why-i-need-to-know-your-budget/
06:46:52 <medos> do you use flipboard?
06:46:56 <Kocho> nup
06:47:12 <medos> i'd recommend trying it
06:47:30 <medos> it's able to make a newspaper style quick way to see what's new
06:47:39 <medos> with your twitter account or any other news source almost
06:47:53 <Kocho> oh cool
06:47:56 <Kocho> ill give it a go

12:27:12 <medos> ah neat
12:31:02 <TheWhisper> oh medos hey
12:31:04 <TheWhisper> was scrollin through
12:31:09 <TheWhisper> Thoughts on the g700?
12:31:13 <TheWhisper> .g logitech g700
12:31:17 <TheWhisper> It looks pretty good
12:31:20 <TheWhisper> A few problems with it
12:31:25 <TheWhisper> but overall I think it looks nice
12:31:33 <TheWhisper> and I held it at the store
12:31:36 <TheWhisper> and it felt nice in my hand
12:31:45 <medos> i hate wireless mice and i hate right hand ergonomic mice
12:31:45 <medos> :p
12:31:50 <TheWhisper> It's wireless/wired
12:31:55 <TheWhisper> :)
12:33:28 <TheWhisper> meaning, it's both
12:34:05 <medos> i hate right hand ergonomic mice
12:36:19 <TheWhisper> if that's the only bad thing you can say about it
12:36:21 <TheWhisper> sounds good :P
12:38:46 <medos> *because i'm not able to use them
12:38:47 <medos> herpaderp
12:38:53 <medos> is it too biggie?
12:39:50 <TheWhisper> didn't seem so when I held it at the store
12:40:01 <TheWhisper> but it was in a molded plastic package
12:40:06 <TheWhisper> so couldn't really press all the buttns
12:40:44 <TheWhisper> brb in 4 hours
12:43:17 <medos> boo

12:53:18 <medos> fuck the mamba
12:55:30 <medos> vadoo does your gang have a crib?
12:55:36 <medos> or your group a website
12:55:37 <medos> rather
12:55:42 <vadoo> :)
12:56:11 <vadoo> http://silktech.gr/ (only in greek, I'm afraid)
12:56:41 <medos> chrome will fix that
12:56:49 <vadoo> http://www.silktech.gr/
12:56:55 <vadoo> add a www.
12:57:03 <vadoo> and now I have to fix our dns :P
12:57:04 <medos> worked
12:57:37 <medos> silktech worked too
12:57:41 <medos> without ww
12:57:43 <medos> *www
13:02:54 <medos> site feeeeels a little outdated
13:03:17 <medos> but considering the greek flag and stuff the colors fit
13:03:33 <vadoo> I'm not saying anything without an attorney
13:03:38 <medos> yeah
13:03:39 <medos> sorry
13:03:52 <vadoo> I know
13:03:52 <medos> i was about to say sorry for just commenting
13:04:16 <vadoo> last redesign was probably 3-4 years ago
13:04:24 <vadoo> and we've left it at that
13:04:28 <medos> but thanks for showing it, even if i'm not a huge fan of the look your site has a consistent style to it
13:05:23 <vadoo> consistancy and ugliness are two very important benefits you get from our work :)
13:07:32 <vadoo> anyway, we mostly do corporate intranet applications with fixed clients these days so we have been neglecting our site
13:09:14 <medos> yeah
13:09:30 <medos> i was about to say it looks more like a dev / complex shizzle service
13:09:40 <medos> than sexy landing page with 3 buttons agency
13:18:45 <medos> your tablet/macscreen solution is awesome though
13:18:52 <medos> never seen that being done
13:18:56 <medos> anywhere
13:19:25 <medos> (the stuff where you have a glossy box containing each screenshot instead of a mac laptop or ipad)
13:19:33 <medos> not bad

13:44:53 <Whispy> hey so medos
13:44:54 <Whispy> seriously
13:45:00 <Whispy> Any comments on the G700?
13:45:09 <medos> ffffffff
13:45:51 <Whispy> ?
13:46:09 <medos> Whispy http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIxNLpYcDa4&hd=1
13:46:34 <Whispy> Can't watch a video now
13:46:38 <Whispy> What about it?
13:47:37 <medos> http://www.razerzone.com/ouroboros
13:47:43 <medos> ^ not video
13:48:34 <Whispy> The specs don't seem very different from the g700
13:48:50 <Whispy> The battery life seems even lol
13:49:08 <Whispy> Buttons seem more awkwardly placed on it
13:49:24 <Whispy> Higher DPI though
13:49:39 <Whispy> g700 can have 1ms response time
13:49:47 <Whispy> the software for it allows you to set from 8ms to 1ms
13:49:57 <medos> duuuuud
13:49:58 <Whispy> to balance cpu usage with response time
13:50:01 <medos> that mouse has
13:50:04 <medos> i can has
13:50:12 <medos> shorter or longer setting
13:50:47 <Whispy> ?
13:50:54 <Whispy> It has response time settings too you mean?
13:51:07 <Whispy> It's also like 50 bucks more than the g700
13:55:09 <Whispy> Did you actually look at the g700's specs?
13:55:42 <medos> no
13:55:52 <medos> i've spent enough time talking sense into you
13:55:53 <medos> :p
13:56:09 <Azra-el> .g razer ouroboros
13:56:59 <Whispy> Azra-el, look at
13:57:03 <Whispy> .g g700 logitech
13:57:35 <Whispy> Anyway, medos, can you tell me why you think the Ouroboros is better than the g700? And ambidextrousness doesn't count.
13:57:44 <Whispy> Cuz I honestly have no idea what you're trying to say :P
13:58:40 <medos> ambidextrousness
13:58:56 <Azra-el> medos... you like ouroboros?
13:59:07 <medos> i like ambidextrousness
13:59:07 <Whispy> Okay ,so for me
13:59:11 <Whispy> Okay
13:59:57 <medos> i don't really know what the big problem is
13:59:59 <medos> ?mouse
14:00:08 <medos> you had a horrible mouse and wanted to buy the same one
14:00:09 <vadoo> the name is definetly a plus
14:00:12 <medos> you don't anymore
14:00:18 <medos> job done
14:00:22 <medos> go out and grab one tiger
14:02:13 <Whispy> lol
14:02:33 <Whispy> So you're saying that you don't see anything really wrong with it then
14:02:35 <Whispy> and you're just being medos
14:03:25 <medos> i looked at the size of the thing
14:03:30 <medos> and saw that it's bigger
14:03:35 <medos> that's all
14:09:46 <Whispy> ok
14:09:51 <Whispy> bigger than what
14:09:52 <Whispy> lol

14:44:31 <marshmallow-9-11> hi there
14:46:36 <marshmallow-9-11> yo medos, random question...
14:46:51 <marshmallow-9-11> were you guys affected by 9/11 at all where you are?
14:49:59 <EDSGD> Marshmallow-9-11 I think you mean 11/9
14:50:26 <marshmallow-9-11> woops.  lol
14:50:30 <medos> marshmallow-9-11 define affected
14:51:06 <marshmallow-9-11> idk, mostly everyone i know can remember that day very vividly 
14:51:25 <marshmallow-9-11> then again, I'm near nyc too so it hits a lot closer to home
14:51:54 <medos> yeah
14:52:43 <marshmallow-9-11> many have friends/family directly affected too...  whether they were in the area or died in the attack.
14:52:46 <medos> uhhhhm, it happened early so it was afternoon here, i'm pretty sure i remember a friend online telling me
14:52:54 <medos> and me not really believing him
14:53:09 <medos> and most tv shows already being interrupted for special reports
14:53:14 <medos> which held on for 2-3 days
14:53:20 <medos> + lots of discussion in school
14:54:11 <marshmallow-9-11> gotchya
14:54:22 <marshmallow-9-11> just wondering how far it spread
14:54:27 <medos> hard to tell how much it affected people here but most industrialized countries feared for similar attacks
14:54:36 <medos> like it was uneasy to know and talk about
14:54:53 <medos> tv-shows showing the same thing over and over again has a pretty lasting effect
14:55:04 <EDSGD> http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/ :D
14:55:08 <marshmallow-9-11> true
14:55:08 <medos> never really talked about it with many people though

15:17:21 <thearrowflies> what makes sense?
15:17:25 <thearrowflies> registering?
15:17:29 <Whispy> If you're unwilling to participate in an important level of governmental process
15:17:36 <Whispy> then why should you be able to participate in another?
15:17:53 <marshmallow-9-11> why you should vote?
15:17:58 <marshmallow-9-11> it's a number's game
15:18:11 <marshmallow-9-11> congress makes protects the largest voting pool of people
15:18:17 <Whispy> Marshmallow, why didn't you make your name 'marshmallow-4-19' on april 19th?
15:18:27 <Whispy> That's the anniversary of the OKC bombing
15:18:29 <marshmallow-9-11> so if you don't wanna get fucked over by legislation, you should vote
15:18:48 <Whispy> Or 'marshmallow-3-5' on march 5th
15:18:52 <medos> oh dear
15:18:53 <marshmallow-9-11> well, 9-11 affected me the most
15:18:55 <Whispy> That's the anniversary of the Boston Massacre
15:18:56 <thearrowflies> im going to get fucked over one way or another and ill have no say on it
15:18:56 <medos> factman
15:19:09 <Whispy> In fact, people in the US die every day
15:19:14 <Whispy> from innumerable causes
15:19:15 <medos> wait
15:19:21 <thearrowflies> whispy, i like how you think
15:19:24 <Whispy> so you should just change your name to match the date eevery day
15:19:29 <medos> Whispy didn't you find it shareworthy when some rapper cried on mtv?
15:19:43 <medos> but you oppose 9-11 tributes?

15:20:21 <Whispy> uh what's the word
15:20:24 <marshmallow-9-11> well, maybe it didn't affect you, but affected my town, my friends, and my family
15:20:29 <Whispy> It affected me
15:20:31 <EDSGD> offended yet
15:20:31 <marshmallow-9-11> *but it affected
15:20:33 <Whispy> I was in the city when it happened
15:20:38 <Whispy> in my dad's office
15:20:45 <Whispy> I could see it out the window
15:20:49 <medos> help
15:20:51 <medos> EDSGD
15:20:54 <Whispy> and I remember it
15:20:56 <EDSGD> http://www.reddit.com/r/circlejerk/
15:20:59 <Whispy> I mourned the people
15:21:00 <Whispy> but not for 10 fucking years
15:21:02 <medos> ^
15:21:09 <thearrowflies> ^^
15:21:10 <marshmallow-9-11> to each his own
15:21:11 <medos> -^^^
15:21:13 <medos> yup
15:21:16 <Whispy> True
15:21:17 <thearrowflies> what whispy said
15:21:19 <thearrowflies> i agree
15:21:20 <Whispy> True true true
15:21:20 <marshmallow-9-11> it's not mourning...  more respecting
15:21:25 <Whispy> I respect them
15:21:29 <Whispy> Well
15:21:33 <Whispy> eh
15:21:34 <marshmallow-9-11> not really
15:21:42 <Whispy> I respect the firemen and police officers
15:21:49 <Whispy> and the people who helped
15:21:52 <EDSGD> Milton GLaser ONLY hires women.
15:21:59 <Whispy> I can't really say I respect everyone else for just being in the wrong place at the wrong time
15:22:25 <Whispy> But my main point is that it's fine to mourn for a while
15:22:26 <marshmallow-9-11> =/
15:22:34 <Whispy> but damn, people need to move on
15:22:41 <Whispy> and get onwith their lives
15:22:57 <Whispy> Sorry if that seems douchey, but living in the past and wallowing in sadness gets no one anywhere
15:23:11 <marshmallow-9-11> not wallowing in sadness...
15:23:17 <marshmallow-9-11> more like rememberance 
15:23:21 <marshmallow-9-11> it's like veterans day
15:23:23 <thearrowflies> i agree, but i dont think marshmallow wants to hear this now
15:23:24 <marshmallow-9-11> or memorial day
15:23:31 <EDSGD> brb I need to activate stuff

18:01:40 <TheWhisper> Except
18:01:44 <TheWhisper> that's not true
18:01:47 <TheWhisper> as I do have ADD
18:01:49 <TheWhisper> lol
18:02:00 <TheWhisper> Haven't we had this discussion
18:02:08 <medos> yes we had
18:02:15 <medos> was it heavily noticeable before you got internet and a pc?
18:02:23 <medos> just want to know that
18:02:26 <medos> not really discuss it atm
18:02:55 <TheWhisper> yes
18:02:57 <TheWhisper> it was noticeable
18:03:02 <TheWhisper> lol
18:03:10 <TheWhisper> that's the thing though
18:03:31 <TheWhisper> it's hard to notice unless you're 1) super capricious or 2) super hyperactive
18:03:41 <TheWhisper> If you're just ADD and not on the extreme end, it can be hard to tell
18:03:54 <TheWhisper> As you personally have no perspective so you think this is just how everyone is
18:04:07 <TheWhisper> and if people aren't looking out for it, it can be very hard for them to see it
18:04:30 <TheWhisper> "What has thus far failed to be properly explained is that when ADHD folk manage to grab a balloon, we tend to latch onto it at the expense of every other balloon. That's why ADD people tend to struggle at prioritizing, and why they're often mistakenly labeled as lazy." <- good post from the thread

19:25:31 <EDSGD2> How big is it?
19:25:40 <medos> 36mb
19:25:50 <medos> 18 seconds
19:25:55 <medos> just an app interface animated

19:27:43 <medos> lol

19:31:17 <medos> .bible job 3:16
19:31:20 <EDSGD2> yeah
19:32:01 <medos> i guess they'd bulge out depending on what menu you are in
19:32:10 <medos> so this video only shows one of those menus
19:32:25 <medos> but the center content would actually change depending on what you tap
19:32:34 <medos> then the tap would make the bulge

19:35:08 <cubic> http://i.imgur.com/TBcZW.png
19:35:17 <medos> LOL
19:35:22 <medos> loving it
19:35:27 <cubic> heh heh
19:35:35 <TheWhisper> LOL
19:35:36 <TheWhisper> genius
19:35:45 <TheWhisper> Looks like it could be a minecraft texture
19:36:22 <cubic> heh heh heh
19:36:26 <cubic> that'd be a good idea.
19:36:45 <TheWhisper> whoa
19:36:51 <TheWhisper> interesting feel
19:39:49 <medos> normal
19:39:51 <medos> not interesting
19:40:32 <TheWhisper> lol
19:40:36 <TheWhisper> so many bootuns
19:41:30 <TheWhisper> hm
19:41:36 <TheWhisper> softwear installatorions
19:42:05 <TheWhisper> Actually, don't have time to do that
19:42:18 <TheWhisper> later then
19:43:01 <medos> bye
19:43:10 <medos> EDSGD1 thank you for feedback :)
19:43:45 <EDSGD2> EDSGD2 foo
19:43:55 <EDSGD2> I really didn't say anything at all
19:43:57 <EDSGD2> :(
19:44:00 <medos> EDSGD1-23-4-5-6-7-8-9
19:44:07 <medos> nope it was a pretty vague respect
19:44:10 <medos> *request
19:44:27 <EDSGD2> ok
19:44:32 <medos> so it's fine
19:44:34 <medos> :)
19:45:10 <TheWhisper> The default mode is too 
19:45:10 <TheWhisper> uh
19:45:14 <TheWhisper> too fast
19:45:29 <TheWhisper> and then one click less sensitive is too slow
19:45:29 <TheWhisper> lol
19:45:33 <TheWhisper> need to adjust that more finely
19:47:42 <R0tt3n> hey EDSGD2, that WWF ad you have on your portfolio, how did you do it?
19:48:05 <R0tt3n> ive always wanted to do that kind of photo manipulation but i could never find the right tutorial
19:53:15 <EDSGD2> What tutorials don't explain is the importance of using a wacom tablet akong side the power of masks
19:55:09 <medos> (or rotating the canvas)
19:55:42 <TheWhisper> Oh sweet
19:55:48 <EDSGD2> that too but seriously using a pen
19:55:48 <TheWhisper> Black Mesa got greenlit
19:56:42 <TheWhisper> uh
19:56:52 <TheWhisper> R0tt3n what in that ad are you curious about?
19:58:16 <R0tt3n> how did you get the skeleton to look so real?
19:58:38 <R0tt3n> also how did you get that skeleton? Did you make it yourself, find a stock picture or what
19:59:11 <TheWhisper> oh lol
20:00:08 <TheWhisper> http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/zph9s/activision_blizzard_secretly_watermarking_world/ whoa
20:00:29 <EDSGD2> R0tt3n you have to make three layers of the same image 
20:00:40 <EDSGD2> 1st image you leave alone 
20:01:25 <EDSGD2> oh no wait.
20:01:36 <medos> link
20:01:41 <medos> to the thing
20:01:47 <medos> thearrowflies good job
20:01:50 <medos> ooooops
20:01:56 <medos> * TheWhisper
20:01:57 <medos> sorry
20:02:00 <TheWhisper> ?
20:02:04 <TheWhisper> good job on what
20:02:23 <EDSGD2> 1st image you call "midtones" add a mask and  an adjustment layer 
20:02:29 <EDSGD2> 2nd image you leave alone
20:02:53 <EDSGD2> 3rd image yo u name "shadows" add a mask along with an adjustment layer
20:03:36 <R0tt3n> ahh i see
20:04:23 <R0tt3n> so how did you get the picture? did you just find some skeleton photo and use that?
20:04:39 <R0tt3n> or is there a more complicated process involving creating it
20:05:44 <EDSGD2> a little bit. just takes time. I could have done a better job if I had a higher res image. And as for the image I got it from getty when I had the account info
20:13:58 <EDSGD2> prepping things properly in indesign is so time consuming
20:15:24 <medos> haha
20:15:28 <medos> the worst part is
20:15:39 <medos> when something doesn't fit after two to three pages
20:17:15 <TheWhisper> yeah
20:17:16 <TheWhisper> speaking of
20:17:21 <TheWhisper> I need to finish that layout I started
20:18:33 <TheWhisper> Medos, if it don't fit, you must acquit.
20:18:44 <TheWhisper> I think OJ Simpson said that about laying out pages in InDesign
20:19:14 <TheWhisper> ha wait
20:19:20 <TheWhisper> "If the text don't fit, you must edit it."
20:19:33 <TheWhisper> "If the text don't fit, then fucking edit it."
20:19:36 <TheWhisper> That has a nice ring.
20:20:27 <TheWhisper> "If your design is shit, then you better quit."
20:20:37 <TheWhisper> "Your design is shit, but please don't quit."
20:20:41 <TheWhisper> okay time for class
20:20:45 <TheWhisper> Fun way to pass 2 minutes
20:28:58 <cubic> "if the text don't fit, change it without your clients approval because fuck them."
20:31:33 <medos> tracking ftw
20:31:38 <medos> and 6.76pt
20:31:41 <medos> instead of 7
20:31:49 <medos> and a bit of manual kerning
20:31:52 <medos> and
20:32:27 <medos> yo
20:32:33 <medos> zigzag borders
20:32:50 <medos> in / out / trendy / boring / hip / old / everywhere / recommended?
20:35:07 <cubic> no idea. 
20:35:35 <cubic> if it works conceptually then it shouldn't matter
20:36:05 <cubic> but if it looks dope then it also shouldn't matter. 
20:36:14 <cubic> a good rule of thumb is to not suck
20:37:15 <medos> conceptually it'll steal space from a list of a smartphone screen

22:30:13 <TheWhisper> using a shim and duct tae
22:30:14 <TheWhisper> tape
22:30:16 <TheWhisper> no more falling mice
22:34:39 <TheWhisper> 5700 dpi is toooooo much

22:36:49 <medos> Then again i never really changed my dpi settings, always been 800.
22:37:07 <VP_> Hi
22:37:08 <TheWhisper> My previous mouse was 100
22:37:18 <TheWhisper> Gonna go set it to that as my default one again when I install the software
22:37:20 <TheWhisper> Hi VP_
22:37:24 <medos> Hi VP_ :)
22:37:31 <TheWhisper> *1000 dpi, not 100 lol
22:37:40 <medos> Yeah.
22:38:05 <VP_> I'm not sure how this works...I don't want to crash any convos, but I have a few questions to ask about starting up a website for a portfolio
22:38:39 <medos> Go ahead . :)
22:38:54 <Kocho> medos, he didn't like the icon
22:39:00 <medos> ohhhh ;(
22:39:09 <Kocho> its ok
22:39:38 <Kocho> he liked the original too, but just to make it a bit more gamey
22:40:29 <medos> VP_ just throw your question in the room, ;)
22:40:38 <TheWhisper> hey medos what do you think this is
22:40:39 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/DwLSu.png
22:40:42 <TheWhisper> left side = mouse
22:40:46 <TheWhisper> right side = laptop touchpad
22:40:51 <Kocho> ;)
22:40:58 <TheWhisper> Do you think it's just cuz the mouse is so sensitive?
22:40:59 <VP_> Where would you recommend I get a domain registered at?
22:41:09 <TheWhisper> Not godaddy.com
22:41:16 <TheWhisper> Dynadot is good, from what I've heard
22:41:22 <Kocho> i have bluehost
22:42:18 <VP_> Haha, no GoDaddy is the only thing I've gotten so far. Also, after I get my name, I have no idea what to do to put up the actual website. What do you do?
22:42:36 <TheWhisper> Ah
22:42:39 <TheWhisper> Well
22:42:44 <TheWhisper> Do you want to do it the easy way or the hard way?
22:43:58 <VP_> Easy being a template and hard being code for myself?
22:44:06 <TheWhisper> Essentially
22:44:11 <medos> http://www.webfaction.com/services/hosting ---- or --------- http://asmallorange.com/hosting/ --------- or --------- https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/services/hosting
22:44:21 <medos> are the three ones that i was told to give a shot
22:44:22 <TheWhisper> http://cargocollective.com/ <- free and easy
22:44:24 <medos> haven't decided yet
22:44:28 <TheWhisper> with pretty customizable templates
22:44:38 <medos> TheWhisper gimme invite.
22:44:51 <TheWhisper> to cargo?
22:44:53 <TheWhisper> you need one?
22:44:55 <medos> Yes.
22:45:02 <TheWhisper> um
22:45:03 <TheWhisper> wtf
22:45:09 <TheWhisper> could my mouse be interfering with my wifi?
22:45:50 <TheWhisper> pmed you
22:45:56 <medos> To maintain the highest possible degree of quality, every site we initiate is by invite only. However, we frequently award memberships to unaffiliated talents who share a sample of their work (contact us).
22:46:08 <TheWhisper> lol
22:46:11 <TheWhisper> how did I get one then
22:46:53 <VP_> Welp. I like to have things completely made by me, but until I learn how to do that, could I also get an invite : ]
22:47:26 <TheWhisper> Show me some work first ;)
22:49:48 <VP_> The winky face makes that almost sexual harassment.  I am on my work computer right now so I don't have anything with me. I am a college student though, so I''m not sure I could show you anything impressive...I am actually looking to do the portfolio to get into my schools design program.
22:52:24 <medos> there's www.behance.net www.carbonmade.com www.flavors.me www.about.me http://www.squarespace.com/
22:52:32 <medos> http://www.lightcms.com/
22:53:36 <medos> .rem portfolio www.squarespace.com - www.behance.net - www.carbonmade.com - www.flavors.me - www.about.me - www.cargocollective.com
22:53:43 <medos> Neat stuff.
22:54:17 <medos> VP_ doesn't need to be impressive, it was more of a general judgement of current level thing.
22:55:21 <medos> Most sites that are invite only are invite only to keep content high quality. Not saying that's the case here but just wanting an invite without any work present is a bit uncomfortable I guess.
22:56:10 <TheWhisper> Hey vp_ do you have like one piece you could show me?
22:57:55 <TheWhisper> If not VP_, I can still give you an invite. I'm just curious :P
22:58:55 <medos> D:
22:59:09 <VP_> I have some really old photography and play around things on my old Facebook profile....haaa
23:00:53 <medos> Don't worry, the whole thing isn't about critiquing or ripping on your stuff. It's just general interest i guess.
23:02:16 <VP_> Okay, well I did this one from a tutorial (http://imgur.com/uSD6l)
23:03:08 <medos> neat
23:03:49 <medos> if TheWhisper is back he should be willing to invite
23:04:03 <TheWhisper> Lemme look
23:04:23 <TheWhisper> terrible. worst thing i've ever seen!
23:04:25 <TheWhisper> jk
23:04:30 <VP_> And a cat (http://imgur.com/LOzqn,NfR9E) and a chameleon (http://imgur.com/LOzqn,NfR9E#1)
23:04:31 <TheWhisper> pretty cool
23:04:43 <TheWhisper> I like the first one
23:04:47 <TheWhisper> the type poster thing
23:05:02 <VP_> Thanks :]
23:05:03 <TheWhisper> though I'd be careful of how close your lines are to each other (letters overlapping make them hard to read)
23:06:07 <VP_> Oh for sure.  I did that one about 3 years ago. Not that I've gotten very far from then
23:06:29 <TheWhisper> I have some photos of cats too
23:06:59 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/TtVR7.png
23:07:25 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/JMYbD.jpg
23:07:27 <medos> If you're trying to get into design school you should stick to less but more expressive stuff like the type poster or the chameleon photo.
23:07:49 <medos> Personal opinion though, a cat photo feels a bit too everday to me.
23:07:52 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/EpJJD.jpg
23:07:55 <TheWhisper> yeah
23:07:56 <TheWhisper> agreed
23:08:08 <TheWhisper> Cat photos are usually only awesome to the person who took them
23:08:10 <VP_> EEEEEEEEE what a cutie. 
23:08:13 <TheWhisper> :P
23:08:15 <TheWhisper> Or not hahaha
23:08:20 <TheWhisper> That's sunny
23:08:24 <TheWhisper> He's my aunt's cat
23:08:28 <TheWhisper> <3 him
23:08:36 <TheWhisper> anyway
23:08:37 <TheWhisper> here's an invite
23:08:51 <VP_> Hahaha. The cat I showed you was Snake. Metal Gar reference.
23:09:08 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/iApWX.png
23:09:09 <TheWhisper> Nice
23:09:13 <medos> CAT PHOTOS
23:09:17 <TheWhisper> medos is that your cat
23:09:19 <TheWhisper> if so i love it
23:09:28 <medos> what if not?
23:09:33 <medos> and i just took that photo?
23:09:43 <TheWhisper> then i hate you but love it
23:09:46 <TheWhisper> http://cargocollective.com/start/282369 VP_
23:09:54 <VP_> Oh my word, came here for help and got even more!
23:10:00 <TheWhisper> VP_, have you ever used IRC before?
23:10:34 <medos> Feel free to stop by more regularly, if you're trying to get into design school it would certainly help to get some feedback along the way.
23:10:53 <medos> Or just pick up from ongoing discussions.
23:11:03 <Kocho> cya
23:11:06 <TheWhisper> what

23:12:25 <TheWhisper> And how most people just sit in here all day idle 
23:12:31 <TheWhisper> and talk a few times throughout the day?
23:12:55 <VP_> Yup yup.  Sorry, I exited on accident

23:29:05 <EDSGD_> :p
23:30:05 <medos> i bet i'll have a gawker invite in my inbox tomorrow
23:31:14 <EDSGD_> You don't need an invite for gawker.
23:31:26 <EDSGD_> Want an invite for ffffound for dribbble?
23:31:34 <medos> sure!
23:31:53 <EDSGD_> I don't have one :(
23:31:58 <medos> i don't either
23:31:59 <medos> yet
23:32:05 <EDSGD_> LOL
23:32:16 <medos> ffffound is impossible unless you're a tumblr hipster
23:32:30 <EDSGD_> le
23:32:48 <EDSGD_> GODDAMN
23:33:11 <EDSGD_> nvm
23:33:19 <EDSGD_> Imma get kicked out
23:33:51 <medos> where
23:34:26 <EDSGD_> nvm
23:34:43 <EDSGD_> so has anyone read the fastco deisgn apple thing?
23:35:36 <medos> about skeumorph / win8 approach internal split?
23:36:03 <EDSGD_> yes
23:36:28 <medos> yes
23:37:35 <medos> to me the apple ios leatherwoodenshizzle stuff feels overdone
23:37:39 <medos> it's not wrong or bad
23:37:43 <medos> just everywhere
23:37:45 <EDSGD_> Seems that you want to have a more in depth discussion rather than me just pointing it out.
23:37:45 <medos> boxes are neat
23:38:11 <medos> lol
23:38:38 <medos> what's your take on it?
23:38:57 <TheWhisper> Overdone
23:39:00 <TheWhisper> and on its way out
23:39:05 <TheWhisper> (hopefully)
23:39:06 <TheWhisper> lol
23:40:10 <medos> it does give some balance to the bare shape of the iphone itself
23:40:31 <TheWhisper> Can I see this article you're talking about?
23:40:32 <medos> industrial metal block with some warm and comfy cushion interfaces
23:41:27 <TheWhisper> link
23:42:01 <TheWhisper> nvm got it
23:42:33 <TheWhisper> ugh
23:42:34 <EDSGD_> basically what you just said. The way I see it that too much care/ detail is given to these things
23:42:37 <TheWhisper> their articles are unreadable
23:42:46 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/ttScz.png
23:42:56 <TheWhisper> does it look that bad for you medos?
23:42:57 <TheWhisper> or edsgd?
23:42:59 <EDSGD_> that they'll loose sight to what is really important
23:43:06 <EDSGD_> which is how it works.
23:43:26 <EDSGD_> I care more about how it works rather than how it looks
23:43:32 <medos> not true
23:43:33 <medos> oh true
23:43:39 <medos> you used that ugly management thing
23:43:45 <EDSGD_> :p
23:43:45 <medos> *use
23:44:00 <TheWhisper> huh?
23:44:04 <TheWhisper> What ugly management thing?
23:44:13 <TheWhisper> oh
23:44:21 <TheWhisper> does it look like this for you guys: http://i.imgur.com/ttScz.png
23:44:37 <EDSGD_> TheWhisper yes.
23:44:47 <EDSGD_> I don't like looking at the site either. 
23:45:10 <medos> TheWhisper do you know readability?
23:45:15 <TheWhisper> yes
23:45:32 <TheWhisper> I actually have a greasemonkey script to do it
23:45:40 <TheWhisper> but it broken and I never bothered fixing it
23:45:45 <TheWhisper> oh
23:45:46 <TheWhisper> sweet
23:45:48 <TheWhisper> it worked
23:45:55 <TheWhisper> guess it just doesn't work on some sites
23:47:00 <EDSGD_> brb gonna tutor

23:58:17 <medos> one guy who stops by here said he had trouble with smaller companies never paying for designers
23:58:27 <medos> and then asked if i'd help out
23:58:50 <medos> "you have to consider that clients want to change everything all the time!"
23:59:21 <Kocho> some people
23:59:22 <Kocho> ffs
23:59:28 <medos> why should i work with someone who lets the client decide on everything D:
23:59:33 <Kocho> how are they even still going
