00:40:29 <EDSGD> Apple is fucking stupid changing the adapter.
00:40:38 <EDSGD> Nintendo knows what's up though.
00:41:16 <EDSGD> I still remember using the same A/V connectors to hook up my Super Nintendo all the way up to my Cube.
00:42:57 <medos> Step 1. pre-order iphone 5
00:43:02 <medos> Step 2. complain
00:43:18 <EDSGD> Yes.
00:43:23 <EDSGD> :D

01:19:03 <TheWhisper> bytes or bits?
01:19:22 <EDSGD> You know what I meant, so it really doesn't matter
01:19:27 <TheWhisper> ?
01:19:29 <EDSGD> Unless you like being specific
01:19:36 <TheWhisper> megabytes are way different than megabits
01:19:42 <EDSGD> I know they are.
01:20:06 <TheWhisper> so, bytes or bits?
01:20:17 <TheWhisper> tytes or tits?

01:21:36 <EDSGD> I'm probably going to get hated on, but I don't like Will Ferrelll
01:21:53 <medos> I don't mind.
01:22:06 <EDSGD> and yes USA Today is cool
01:22:29 <medos> it's weird as fuck

01:22:47 <EDSGD> It'll grow on you.
01:22:52 <EDSGD> :p
01:22:56 <TheWhisper> Medos, we talked about this earlier.
01:22:58 <medos> it's like "holy fuck that article almost jumped in my face"
01:23:06 <TheWhisper> I think the lightboxing of the articles is genius
01:23:12 <TheWhisper> and is going to be the new thing
01:23:16 * medos dodges to the left
01:23:19 <medos> no it's not
01:23:23 <TheWhisper> I disagree.
01:23:31 <TheWhisper> It makes it seem faster 
01:23:32 <TheWhisper> for most people
01:23:37 <TheWhisper> And it's still linkable
01:23:46 <TheWhisper> and, to be honest, it's easier
01:23:50 <TheWhisper> Why do you disagree?
01:25:05 <medos> it's the google wave of news websites
01:25:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/VxIAp.png
01:25:10 <medos> + ^
01:26:01 <TheWhisper> Did you really miss the entire discussion we had on it?
01:26:14 <medos> oh hai i'm reading this and by accident click on the dark area on the side
01:26:17 <TheWhisper> I even specifically said, "Medos, look at the impossible shadows and ribbons they had"
01:26:20 <medos> article close
01:26:23 <medos> yeah
01:26:28 <medos> i don't click your links
01:26:30 <TheWhisper> And I though about that,
01:26:32 <medos> remember
01:26:32 <TheWhisper> *though
01:26:45 <TheWhisper> but they made the dark area pretty small
01:26:56 <TheWhisper> Oh
01:27:01 <TheWhisper> Actually, I thought it was smaller than it was
01:27:20 <TheWhisper> I still don't think it's a big deal 
01:27:21 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/3jRRM.png
01:27:23 <TheWhisper> That is though
01:27:41 <TheWhisper> That fucking bar is supposed to be "below" the story
01:27:46 <TheWhisper> but the story is also somehow below the bar
01:27:47 <TheWhisper> wtf
01:27:59 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/wLJvu.png ?
01:28:07 <medos> it's just degrading news to twitter style headlines
01:28:11 <TheWhisper> eh
01:28:22 <medos> fuck info - find a flashy headline to grab interest
01:28:29 <TheWhisper> I can see why some would think it trivializes content
01:28:31 <medos> 160 characters or less
01:28:43 <EDSGD> Here
01:28:44 <EDSGD> http://i.imgur.com/f8Mtw.jpg
01:28:47 <EDSGD> happy?
01:28:56 <TheWhisper> lol
01:29:04 <medos> no
01:29:11 <TheWhisper> I think we can all agree that it's a step up from what they have now though
01:29:15 <medos> wont change the fact that the article closes when i link it
01:29:18 <medos> *click it
01:29:20 <medos> meh
01:29:33 <TheWhisper> To be honest, it's not even much different than what they have now.
01:29:39 <TheWhisper> What
01:29:43 <TheWhisper> The articles don't close when you click tthem
01:29:44 <TheWhisper> *them
01:30:12 <medos> open an article
01:30:18 <medos> and click the dark area left or right to it
01:30:30 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/wLJvu.png
01:30:41 <medos> now lets say you have a touchpad
01:30:43 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/PJ5zl.png
01:30:44 <medos> or touch input device
01:30:46 <medos> and touch the screen
01:30:50 <TheWhisper> The red are the close area
01:30:51 <TheWhisper> that's it
01:30:53 <TheWhisper> meh
01:30:57 <medos> yes
01:30:59 <TheWhisper> I think it's time people learn 
01:31:09 <TheWhisper> how the fuck to use the internet
01:31:22 <medos> lol
01:31:23 <medos> kk
01:31:31 <TheWhisper> Say everyone who used the site
01:31:35 <TheWhisper> knew what lightboxes were
01:31:41 <TheWhisper> and how to close them by clicking outside
01:31:42 <TheWhisper> etc etc
01:31:48 <TheWhisper> Would you still think it would be a problem then?
01:32:09 <medos> yes
01:32:13 <medos> touchpad
01:32:21 <TheWhisper> I'm using a touchpad right now
01:32:23 <TheWhisper> it works fine
01:32:24 <TheWhisper> ?
01:32:27 <medos> nevermind
01:32:34 <TheWhisper> How is the touchpad different than a mouse?
01:32:36 <medos> if you gauge usability by your usage
01:32:39 <TheWhisper> Bad question
01:32:42 <medos> no
01:32:42 <TheWhisper> but you know what I mean
01:32:44 <medos> valid question
01:32:47 <TheWhisper> Do you mean like
01:32:49 <TheWhisper> a touch screen?
01:32:52 <medos> no
01:32:54 <TheWhisper> Or a laptop mousepade?
01:32:55 <TheWhisper> *pad
01:32:55 <TheWhisper> okay
01:32:55 <medos> touchpad on laptop
01:33:03 <TheWhisper> So how does the usage of that on a lightbox differ?
01:33:13 <medos> nevermind really
01:33:26 <medos> if you presume everyone is or has to be as skilled with mouse/touchpad input devices
01:33:29 <medos> then i can't change that
01:33:39 <TheWhisper> I wasn't presuming that
01:33:49 <TheWhisper> I was saying that it's 1) possible and 2) inevitable
01:34:06 <TheWhisper> omg
01:34:07 <TheWhisper> OMG
01:34:12 <TheWhisper> DID YOU SEE PROJECT ETERNITY?
01:34:29 <TheWhisper> BALDUR'S GATE MEETS PS:T
01:34:32 <medos> no, my fat fingers hit the touchpad and closed the movie

01:52:52 <TheWhisper> "Our goal is to use voice over as flavor and not as something that exists for every written word in the game. We dont want to cut down on the depth of dialogs or the number of choices that players have because we are counting voice over dollars."
01:52:54 <TheWhisper> YES YES YES
01:53:00 <medos> yeyeye
01:53:21 <TheWhisper> I'm so happy they're not gonna try to voice everything
01:53:30 <TheWhisper> As that would restrict them so much in terms of depth

05:49:19 <zakmac> Was about to google it

05:49:35 <EDSGD> No. Its just a scene that stands out for me.

12:33:33 <zakmac> Tuna?
12:34:27 <medos> .u tuna
12:34:47 <medos> well, not that kind of tuna
12:35:37 <medos> common slang for good moment in a song or generally awesome song is "tune"
12:35:56 <medos> and there's a certain group of people who slangified that further to "tuna"
12:35:56 <zakmac> Dig it
12:36:46 <zakmac> Which movie to fall asleep watching… The Lorax or Tower Heist
12:37:04 <zakmac> Decisions, decisions
12:37:18 <medos> I would wholeheartedly recommend Cabin In The Woods.
12:37:28 <medos> It's very likely that you've already seen that one though.
12:37:39 <zakmac> Saw it in theaters
12:37:52 <medos> .choose The Lorax, Tower Heist
12:37:58 <medos> there ya go
12:37:59 <zakmac> Increasingly common for me for some reason. I should stop since tickets are ~$14 a movie and the theater blows
12:38:30 <zakmac> .choose hire a prostitute for medos, shoot medos
12:38:44 <zakmac> Ouch, Awesomius has ruled
12:39:03 <zakmac> .bomb zakmac
12:39:04 <medos> Yeah, I saw it yesterday as fall-asleep-movie, I would never have enjoyed it as much as I did with people around me laughing and pulling out their cellphones.
12:39:06 <zakmac> Hmph
12:39:17 <medos> .help shows commands
12:39:21 <zakmac> .help
12:39:29 <medos> in private ;)
12:39:47 <zakmac> Oh nice
12:39:54 <medos> .tell zakmac it has that feature you wanted about sending messages for later
12:40:05 <medos> (.tell works in pm with the bot too)
12:40:32 <zakmac> .tell edsgd http://imgur.com/q5gUS (suck it)
12:40:42 <zakmac> He's nifty
12:41:32 <zakmac> Where'd you end up installing this bot anyway>
12:42:05 <medos> Azra-el works at a vfx company
12:42:12 <medos> and they tend to be pretty lax about stuff
12:42:21 <zakmac> Ah nice
12:42:31 <medos> so the bot runs on their dedicated server in a small virtualized isolated environment
12:42:43 <zakmac> Alright well time for Lorax and sleepy time <3
12:43:01 <medos> good night
12:43:13 <medos> i'll hide to prevent getting shot

14:42:02 <medos> TheWhisper http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_of_Hard_Disk_Drive_Manufacturer_Consolidation.svg
14:42:14 <TheWhisper> Lol
14:42:19 <TheWhisper> So, seagate, toshiba, or wd?
14:43:00 <medos> it depends on what you want to do with that drive really
14:43:02 <medos> also: http://i.imgur.com/f9hZ7.png
14:43:14 <TheWhisper> LOL
14:43:39 <TheWhisper> hm
14:43:39 <medos> lemme check
14:44:00 <TheWhisper> Need something with fast read/write
14:44:09 <TheWhisper> Using it as a scratch disk
14:44:40 <medos> lol
14:44:50 <medos> that's not going to work
14:45:04 <medos> .g photoshop scratch disk external usb

14:45:26 <medos> TheWhisper
14:45:27 <medos> TheWhisper
14:45:29 <medos> it would
14:45:30 <medos> be
14:45:30 <medos> nice
14:45:31 <medos> if
14:45:31 <TheWhisper> lol
14:45:32 <medos> you
14:45:33 <medos> would
14:45:34 <medos> not
14:45:35 <medos> just

14:45:53 <medos> go buy some bullshit hdd
14:46:02 <TheWhisper> And it's not for photoshop
14:46:08 <TheWhisper> It's for animation stuff

14:47:09 <TheWhisper> medos, think I should get an SSD?
14:47:16 <TheWhisper> Or is that dumb for an external?
14:47:33 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/jRhZ6.png
14:47:50 <TheWhisper> lol
14:48:01 <medos> how fucking hard is it
14:48:06 <medos> to at least check
14:48:08 <medos> before you talk
14:48:11 <TheWhisper> I don't know how to check
14:48:11 <medos> D:
14:48:12 <TheWhisper> that
14:49:07 <medos> ok
14:49:09 <medos> two solutions
14:49:18 <medos> either you replace your internal hdd with a new ssd
14:49:37 <TheWhisper> oh cool
14:49:41 <medos> and use your internal hdd as either e-sata or rip out your
14:49:42 <TheWhisper> ./mode ##design +b
14:49:43 <TheWhisper> lists bans
14:49:53 <medos> attention
14:50:04 <TheWhisper> rip out my attention?
14:50:09 <medos> yes
14:50:11 <medos> that's what you do
14:50:22 <medos> rip out your cd/dvd-drive and use a hdd bay
14:50:22 <TheWhisper> I'm still paying attention lol
14:50:25 <TheWhisper> hm
14:50:27 <TheWhisper> well
14:50:37 <TheWhisper> I'd rather not fuck with my laptop's innards
14:50:47 <TheWhisper> if I don't have to :(
14:51:05 <medos> if neither of those works for you: usb connected shit is too slow to be used as scratch disk
14:51:05 <medos> the problem isn't the speed itself neccessarily but the access time
14:51:06 <TheWhisper> even if it's an ssd?
14:51:07 <medos> .g usb vs esata external hdd
14:51:16 <medos> no
14:51:26 <medos> ssd drives magically make the limitations of usb disappear
14:51:31 <medos> they're like
14:51:37 <TheWhisper> Oh
14:51:41 <medos> "hey usb you're either able to receive or send data"
14:51:52 <TheWhisper> I though you were saying it wasn't the USB that was the problem
14:51:54 <medos> and an ssd drive will say "fuck the rules imma work well on usb"
14:51:59 <TheWhisper> but the spin time for the access
14:52:18 <medos> usb connected shit is too slow to be used as scratch disk
14:52:24 <medos> the problem isn't the speed itself neccessarily but the access time
14:52:30 <medos> of usb
14:52:42 <medos> because reading and writing randomly can't happen at the same time / takes longer
14:52:45 <medos> /fin
14:53:04 <TheWhisper> Ah
14:53:08 <TheWhisper> Hm
14:53:14 <TheWhisper> That stands even with usb 3
14:53:15 <TheWhisper> ?
14:53:51 <TheWhisper> "USB 3.0 allows simultaneous reading and writing between two connected devices."
14:54:01 <medos> http://techcrunch.com/2010/02/05/esata-is-faster-than-usb-3-0-at-least-right-now/
14:54:44 <medos> tl;dr: esata is the only thing you want to use for scratchdisking
14:54:54 <TheWhisper> Yeah, but that's not really feasible for me right now
14:55:08 <medos> you say it's for animation and not photoshop, i say animation needs more scratch disking than photoshop so your case would be worse
14:55:09 <TheWhisper> Because as far as I can tell, the only way I could do that would be to gut my laptop
14:55:24 <medos> you say that without having read the manual
14:55:41 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxv1LTbjNDA
14:55:43 <TheWhisper> I know I don't have an esata port
14:55:46 <TheWhisper> on the outside
14:56:09 <medos> i don't believe you
14:56:27 <medos> name of your laptop?
14:56:40 <TheWhisper> hm
14:56:46 <TheWhisper> Actually there is this port I don't know what it does
14:56:47 <TheWhisper> HP Pavilion dv7t-4000

14:57:51 <TheWhisper> http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs47/f/2009/203/1/c/Computer_hardware_poster_1_7_by_Sonic840.png
14:57:55 <TheWhisper> so let's see the esata
14:58:48 <medos> you're probably using one of your e-sata ports right now
14:58:55 <medos> because they're mostly combined with a usb-port
14:58:56 <TheWhisper> With what
14:58:56 <TheWhisper> lol
14:59:01 <TheWhisper> I have a VGA port
14:59:06 <TheWhisper> HDMI
14:59:09 <medos> if one of your usb ports
14:59:13 <medos> looks a little different
14:59:14 <medos> then
14:59:15 <TheWhisper> Ethernet
14:59:20 <medos> = usb + esata
14:59:23 <TheWhisper> can usb plug into esata?
14:59:24 <TheWhisper> ooh
14:59:45 <TheWhisper> hm
14:59:46 <medos> no it can't it's just the same space in one connector used for two different connections
14:59:46 <TheWhisper> they look the same
14:59:55 <TheWhisper> omg
14:59:55 <TheWhisper> wait
15:00:25 <medos> http://www.hitechreview.com/uploads/2009/05/msi-power-esata-11.jpg
15:00:51 <TheWhisper> I have one I think :D
15:01:16 <TheWhisper> How can i tell if it's eSATA or SATA?
15:01:20 <TheWhisper> Or is that not a thing
15:01:49 <TheWhisper> Ah, esata is external
15:01:54 <TheWhisper> and sata is internal?
15:01:59 <TheWhisper> okay
15:02:00 <TheWhisper> nevermind then
15:02:03 <medos> :\
15:02:12 <TheWhisper> oh lol
15:02:15 <TheWhisper> I know what sata is
15:02:20 <TheWhisper> dumb
15:02:23 <TheWhisper> okay
15:02:25 <TheWhisper> anyway
15:02:36 <TheWhisper> so I have one
15:03:26 <TheWhisper> How come I don't see it listed in my device manager though?
15:05:11 <TheWhisper> Maybe I don't have the drivers for it
15:06:59 <medos> don't derail
15:07:05 <medos> you have an e-sata
15:07:07 <medos> connector
15:07:20 <medos> and an external ssd is bullshit useless
15:07:34 <medos> that's all you need to know really
15:08:06 <TheWhisper> okay
15:08:08 <TheWhisper> So
15:08:09 <TheWhisper> esata
15:08:26 <medos> (16:50:37) (@TheWhisper): I'd rather not fuck with my laptop's innards <- everyone should learn how to replace laptop parts
15:08:28 <medos> yes
15:08:38 <medos> esata - if you want to use it as a scratch disk
15:08:51 <TheWhisper> If push came to shove, I would fuxx with the insides
15:09:00 <TheWhisper> But if I don't have to, I don't want to
15:09:20 <medos> usb 3.0 usb powered - for data archiving and music / movies
15:09:24 <TheWhisper> k
15:09:33 <medos> ussb 3.0 external power supply - for file saving and read/write stuff
15:09:43 <medos> not enough for scratchdiskusage though
15:09:47 <TheWhisper> hm
15:09:53 <medos> DerPfeilFliegt might have more info than i do on this
15:09:58 <TheWhisper> No eSATA filter option on Amazon? Interesting.
15:10:02 <medos> i just go by logic and what i know for usage like that
15:10:08 <medos> .g newegg
15:10:49 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I'm on Newegg too
15:11:16 <TheWhisper> Whats thunderbolt
15:11:23 <TheWhisper> Oh, apple shit
15:11:38 <medos> good luck mang
15:11:59 <TheWhisper> Powered vs unpowered?
15:13:43 <medos> usb drives with separate power plug/connector/adaptoeoeoer = better performance
15:14:03 <TheWhisper> okay
15:14:04 <TheWhisper> hm
15:14:07 <TheWhisper> ioSafe
15:14:12 <TheWhisper> Never heard of them
15:14:25 <TheWhisper> And that's 200 bucks more than all the others
15:14:26 <TheWhisper> no thank you
15:15:12 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kZ4irwlyEY
15:15:42 <TheWhisper> hm
15:16:35 <TheWhisper> should i do it
15:17:12 <TheWhisper> Mine's a different model though, so it may not have that second bay

15:19:29 <TheWhisper> I know what an SSD is
15:19:37 <medos> apparently not
15:19:40 <TheWhisper> ?
15:19:43 <medos> if you wanted to use an external SSD
15:19:46 <TheWhisper> lol
15:19:48 <medos> and keep a hdd inside of your laptop
15:19:49 <medos> wtf
15:19:53 <medos> watch those videos
15:19:57 <TheWhisper> That was because I didn't want to do work ;(
15:20:02 <TheWhisper> but if its' really that easy
15:20:03 <TheWhisper> I'll do it
15:20:18 <medos> it's super easy to replace a hdd inside a laptop
15:20:31 <TheWhisper> I always thought it would be much harder
15:20:31 <medos> 3-5 screws + unplug
15:20:35 <TheWhisper> and I'd have to like take out a lot of shit
15:20:39 <medos> plug + 3-5 screws
15:20:40 <TheWhisper> and then put it all back in
15:20:43 <medos> done
15:21:21 <TheWhisper> what
15:21:27 <TheWhisper> amazon says I only have one credit card
15:21:54 <medos> uhhhhh
15:22:02 <medos> are you buying a hdd / sdd after 10 minutes of research ?!
15:22:04 <TheWhisper> no
15:22:05 <TheWhisper> lol
15:22:09 <TheWhisper> hahaha
15:22:18 <medos> k
15:22:19 <TheWhisper> Buying some books for school
15:24:34 <TheWhisper> okay
15:24:34 <TheWhisper> had to get that out of the way
15:24:34 <TheWhisper> now back to looking at this shit
15:24:34 <TheWhisper> uh
15:24:34 <TheWhisper> The SSD barely did anything in Maya?
15:24:34 <TheWhisper> Is that what you were intending to show?
15:26:47 <medos> sorry, couldn't find tests where a ssd drive was connected as external scratch disk
15:26:47 <TheWhisper> Lol
15:26:47 <TheWhisper> http://www.newmodeus.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=2_5&products_id=345
15:26:48 <TheWhisper> Hm
15:27:01 <TheWhisper> There's the other question of whether it's worth upgrading my laptop at this point in time, though
15:27:13 <medos> it is
15:27:21 <medos> 6gb ram and i7 is more than enough
15:27:23 <TheWhisper> Well
15:27:40 <medos> internal ssd will speed the whole desktop and usability thing
15:27:42 <medos> a lot
15:27:52 <medos> .g biggest boost for old laptop
15:28:46 <medos> nevermind that
15:28:47 <TheWhisper> I've had this since 
15:28:47 <medos> http://lifehacker.com/5920627/now-is-a-great-time-to-buy-an-ssd
15:28:48 <TheWhisper> uh
15:28:49 <TheWhisper> 2009
15:28:49 <medos> read this
15:28:56 <TheWhisper> And I'm wondering if it's nearing EOL
15:30:02 <medos> i'll do landingpaging now

16:59:32 <medos> fridgu palu
16:59:39 <EDSGD> What?
16:59:44 <medos> yes
16:59:59 <EDSGD> LOL I don't, but I have shit to do.

17:15:50 <TheWhisper> medos derpfeilfliegt
17:15:56 <DerPfeilFliegt> ?
17:16:37 <TheWhisper> uh
17:16:40 <TheWhisper> Well
17:16:53 <TheWhisper> I was thinking about getting an external 1tb for scratchdisk stuff
17:17:03 <TheWhisper> but then medos suggested that I just put in a second drive into my laptop
17:17:05 <TheWhisper> which I could do also
17:17:12 <TheWhisper> but then I'm wondering whether it's even worth that
17:17:18 <TheWhisper> as my laptop is from 2009
17:17:21 <TheWhisper> and may be nearing eol
17:17:23 <DerPfeilFliegt> yeah
17:17:26 * TheWhisper ** WinSys ** Client: FortIRC 1513 (x64) ** OS: Microsoft Windows 7 Professional  ** CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU       Q 720  @ 1.60GHz (1.00 GHz) ** RAM: 6077 MB Total (2552 MB Free) ** VGA: ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5650   ** Uptime: 71.24 Hours **
17:17:29 <DerPfeilFliegt> i think its better to get an external
17:17:29 <TheWhisper> my specs
17:17:43 <TheWhisper> Why?
17:17:47 <DerPfeilFliegt> not bad
17:18:17 <DerPfeilFliegt> because then you dont have to hassle with opening up your laptop
17:18:24 <medos> not second drive inside your laptooooooop
17:18:27 <TheWhisper> Well, medos found a video of the procedure for my laptop
17:18:29 <TheWhisper> and it's super easy to do
17:18:37 <medos> exchange internal hdd with ssd and go e-sata with former internal hdd
17:18:41 <medos> was what i suggested
17:18:41 <TheWhisper> oh
17:18:44 <TheWhisper> No
17:18:56 <DerPfeilFliegt> its not a good idea to copy over an entire os onto an ssd
17:19:04 <DerPfeilFliegt> its better if you reinstall w7
17:19:08 <medos> ^
17:19:09 <DerPfeilFliegt> and i dont think he want to do that
17:19:13 <TheWhisper> Ah
17:19:36 <TheWhisper> Yeah
17:19:54 <TheWhisper> I mean, I was going to build a nice desktop for my next computer when this thing dies
17:20:04 <TheWhisper> So I'm not sure if it's worth investing in it at this point in its life
17:20:06 <medos> you could use the ssd in your new machine
17:20:27 <TheWhisper> edsgd http://i.imgur.com/SeuzL.png
17:20:30 <TheWhisper> Yeah, true
17:20:36 <TheWhisper> hm
17:20:51 <EDSGD> :(
17:21:10 <TheWhisper> I wonder what the size specs are for the main bay
17:21:17 <medos> 2.5
17:21:44 <TheWhisper> The main and 2nd are the same?
17:21:58 <medos> i told you to do e-sata
17:22:07 <medos> not rip your laptop apart and mod a second hdd inside
17:22:19 <TheWhisper> There is a second bay though
17:22:28 <TheWhisper> http://www.newmodeus.com/pics/HP-ENVY-17/Envy-17-HDD-close-up-b.jpg
17:22:35 <TheWhisper> And you were soooo not clear about that lol
17:22:43 <TheWhisper> You linked me the video of the person putting in the second HDD
17:22:47 <medos> 1.8
17:22:51 <medos> looks like
17:24:40 <medos> it's more fun to play the guessing game than reading the specs datasheet or manual i guess
17:24:50 <TheWhisper> http://www.newmodeus.com/pics/HP-ENVY-17/Envy-17-HDD-close-up-b.jpg is the main drive
17:24:55 <TheWhisper> whoops
17:24:56 <TheWhisper> http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16822148374
17:24:58 <TheWhisper> is the main drive
17:25:20 <medos> .g HP-ENVY-17 specifications pdf
17:25:29 <EDSGD> Interesting http://reditr.com/#!/Home
17:26:04 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/4tXqH.png doesn't tell me sizes 
17:27:25 <TheWhisper> Okay wait
17:27:26 <TheWhisper> got it
17:27:31 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/lNQt7.png
17:27:46 <DerPfeilFliegt> my homework: http://i.imgur.com/Sr8t0.png
17:28:13 <medos> lol
17:28:46 <TheWhisper> lol
17:29:01 <medos> i'm wondering if that's clever
17:29:12 <medos> or just an accident
17:29:21 <TheWhisper> so
17:29:24 <TheWhisper> my options
17:29:31 <TheWhisper> 1) get an external drive with esata
17:29:36 <EDSGD> The heat is making me extremeley lazy
17:29:39 <TheWhisper> 2) get an internal SSD
17:30:13 <TheWhisper> hm
17:30:21 <DerPfeilFliegt> does your laptop support usb 3.0
17:30:25 <TheWhisper> Yes
17:30:31 <TheWhisper> But eSATA is faster
17:30:38 <medos> TheWhisper http://i.imgur.com/PHDG4.png
17:30:57 <medos> why
17:31:04 <medos> are you unable to read a pdf file :(
17:31:22 <TheWhisper> That's not my laptop
17:31:24 <TheWhisper> That's why
17:31:27 <TheWhisper> Also, http://i.imgur.com/BOPBA.png
17:32:05 <medos> yeah
17:32:10 <TheWhisper> well the thing then is
17:32:17 <TheWhisper> Correct me if I'm wrong
17:32:21 <medos> i'll be back in a bit
17:32:25 <TheWhisper> but the way people usually do it is they get a smallish SSD
17:32:28 <TheWhisper> for their OS and such
17:32:32 <DerPfeilFliegt> yes
17:32:35 <TheWhisper> and then a bigger normal drive
17:32:36 <TheWhisper> for other shit
17:32:40 <DerPfeilFliegt> yup
17:32:59 <TheWhisper> So, I'd have to reinstall windows on the SSD
17:33:04 <DerPfeilFliegt> yeah
17:33:12 <TheWhisper> hm
17:33:19 <medos> (16:47:09) (@TheWhisper): medos, think I should get an SSD?
17:33:19 <medos> (16:47:16) (@TheWhisper): Or is that dumb for an external?
17:33:26 <TheWhisper> ;(
17:33:38 <TheWhisper> Then there's the fact that my main HDD would still only be a 500gig one
17:34:42 <TheWhisper> I assume people also put like all their programs on the SSD?
17:35:05 <DerPfeilFliegt> no
17:35:07 <DerPfeilFliegt> just the os
17:35:09 <TheWhisper> really
17:35:13 <TheWhisper> how do you do that then
17:35:17 <DerPfeilFliegt> i install everything on my other drive
17:35:19 <TheWhisper> with the program files folder being on a different drive?
17:35:23 <DerPfeilFliegt> well
17:35:25 <medos> http://lifehacker.com/5932009/the-complete-guide-to-solid+state-drives
17:35:36 <DerPfeilFliegt> you could change the registry option to install to the other drive
17:35:38 <TheWhisper> And why wouldn't you put your programs on the SSD?
17:35:47 <DerPfeilFliegt> but i just change the install from C to F every time
17:36:03 <DerPfeilFliegt> because i dont care if trillian is blazing fast
17:36:08 <TheWhisper> lol
17:36:18 <TheWhisper> So you have win 7 installed on your ssd now and that's it?
17:36:20 <medos> photoshop and steam should be blazing fast though
17:36:23 <DerPfeilFliegt> yup
17:36:27 <TheWhisper> How much space is that?
17:36:53 <DerPfeilFliegt> 36.6 gb
17:36:54 <DerPfeilFliegt> but
17:37:00 <DerPfeilFliegt> some programs only installed to C
17:37:06 <TheWhisper> hm
17:37:07 <DerPfeilFliegt> like
17:37:09 <DerPfeilFliegt> my drivers
17:37:13 <DerPfeilFliegt> or java
17:37:22 <DerPfeilFliegt> wow
17:37:25 <medos> or temporary files
17:37:26 <DerPfeilFliegt> a ton of stuff did 
17:37:27 <TheWhisper> See then my problem is I don't think I'd free up more than like 70 gigs from my hdd
17:37:27 <DerPfeilFliegt> yeah
17:37:34 <TheWhisper> by putting stuff on the ssd
17:37:37 <medos> TheWhisper http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link
17:38:00 <TheWhisper> So really I think I'd have to upgrade my main HDD too
17:38:07 <medos> you could make a symbolic link on your SSD drive C:\Program Files\HDD\ TOOLS
17:38:08 <TheWhisper> because 500 gigs is restrictive
17:38:27 <medos> which leads to D:\Programs\ (your external)
17:38:31 <TheWhisper> yeah
17:38:33 <DerPfeilFliegt> 2.5inch 1tb drives might be expensive?
17:38:34 <TheWhisper> okay
17:38:54 <TheWhisper> If they are
17:39:02 <TheWhisper> then that raises the question once again
17:39:11 <TheWhisper> of whether I should bother upgrading my laptop with them
17:39:39 <DerPfeilFliegt> well
17:39:44 <medos> a hard drive is the most flexible fucking upgrade there is :p
17:39:47 <TheWhisper> yeah
17:39:49 <DerPfeilFliegt> you can always use those drives on a new desktop
17:39:51 <medos> i have like 10 hdd's here
17:39:55 <DerPfeilFliegt> so its not like your losing money
17:39:56 <medos> old ones
17:40:00 <TheWhisper> but why spend money on a 1tb 2.5mm drive 
17:40:08 <TheWhisper> when I can spend less on a 2tb 69.5mm drive
17:40:12 <TheWhisper> or some shit
17:40:15 <EDSGD> Really google http://i.imgur.com/mMPHL.png
17:40:26 <TheWhisper> That's so old lol
17:40:29 <medos> TheWhisper internal 2.5 ssd and external e-sata 3.5
17:40:37 <medos> ya kno
17:40:40 <TheWhisper> hm
17:40:47 <DerPfeilFliegt> ditch it and build a new desktop
17:40:53 <DerPfeilFliegt> and sell it before it breaks
17:40:55 <TheWhisper> I'm wondering if that's not the best option
17:41:25 <TheWhisper> Just start building a desktop nowish
17:41:46 <medos> you could use your laptop to render
17:41:48 <medos> like
17:41:52 <medos> stick it in a corner somewhere
17:41:58 <medos> boot via wake on lan
17:42:02 <medos> throw render shit on there
17:42:10 <medos> and work on your desktop hassle free
17:42:21 <TheWhisper> yeah
17:42:23 <DerPfeilFliegt> and also as a medis server
17:42:26 <DerPfeilFliegt> media
17:42:39 <medos> and as a torrenting/whichever device
17:43:03 <TheWhisper> okay 2.5" 240gb  SSDs start at $150
17:43:14 <DerPfeilFliegt> why 240?
17:43:29 <TheWhisper> why not
17:43:31 <TheWhisper> lol
17:43:42 <medos> read that lifehacker
17:43:44 <medos> article
17:43:57 <medos> www.lifehacker.com/5932009/the-complete-guide-to-solid+state-drives
17:43:58 <medos> pls
17:44:26 <TheWhisper> yeah
17:44:29 <TheWhisper> I did
17:44:34 <TheWhisper> They don't mention size
17:44:37 <TheWhisper> like physical size
17:44:49 <TheWhisper> and they say that 120 and 240 gb are good sizes for memory
17:45:51 <TheWhisper> Does "Supports all Serial ATA" mean that it supports SATA III too?
17:46:03 <DerPfeilFliegt> windows itself is only 16gb? and photoshop is only ~1gb, do you really need 240?
17:46:19 <DerPfeilFliegt> yeah
17:46:28 <TheWhisper> kk
17:46:42 <TheWhisper> Yeah, probs not
17:46:43 <TheWhisper> okay
17:46:55 <TheWhisper> Well, the drives don't look too expensive
17:46:55 <TheWhisper> hm
17:47:07 <DerPfeilFliegt> 64-128 is good
17:47:10 <TheWhisper> I mean, realistically it comes down to which would be better for the future
17:47:25 <TheWhisper> And I'm thinking building the desktop and not adding shit to my laptop is the way to go in that regard
17:47:34 <medos> lol
17:47:36 <DerPfeilFliegt> pcpartpicker.com
17:47:43 <medos> also r/buildapc
17:47:51 <TheWhisper> yup

17:48:40 <TheWhisper> I've built a computer before
17:48:43 <TheWhisper> Well, helped build one
17:49:32 <TheWhisper> So you guys agree that's my best option?
17:49:44 <DerPfeilFliegt> i always say yes to a new desktop
17:50:19 <medos> i'm just getting annoyed already by weeks of "this mainboard that mainboard"
17:50:33 <TheWhisper> Hahaha
17:50:42 <medos> but other than that: desktops beat laptops in power/stability anyday
17:50:49 <TheWhisper> I'll annoy the guys in bapc :P
17:50:56 <DerPfeilFliegt> asrock z77 professional :p
17:51:10 <medos> i always liked gigabyte
17:51:43 <TheWhisper> okay
17:51:45 <TheWhisper> first things first
17:51:52 <TheWhisper> reserve a dust free room at the local store
17:52:07 <DerPfeilFliegt> wut
17:52:09 <TheWhisper> that would actually be pretty cool if places did that
17:52:09 <DerPfeilFliegt> why?
17:52:14 <medos> lol
17:52:15 <TheWhisper> Was kidding :P
17:52:17 <DerPfeilFliegt> oh lol
