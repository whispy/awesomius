00:50:15 <TheWhisper> Also, why couldn't people just say 'add more detail'
00:50:19 <TheWhisper> Would've saved so much time ;(
00:50:23 <TheWhisper> though
00:50:27 <TheWhisper> probably wouldn't have learned anything ;)
00:56:26 <EDSGD_> and color too founbfry lookingb for me
00:56:33 <EDSGD_> :p
00:56:45 <EDSGD_> *foundry

01:31:02 <TheWhisper> but it sort of just looks like a fancy p
01:31:07 <TheWhisper> and not a p/y
01:31:17 <TheWhisper> I see it because you told me, but otherwise I wouldn't have
01:31:51 <marshmallow> well, that might be a good thing then
01:31:56 <marshmallow> cause his name starts with a P
01:32:01 <marshmallow> which is more important

03:24:27 <marshmallow> i see shitloads of cops everyday
03:24:34 <TheWhisper> lol
03:24:36 <TheWhisper> He means toronto
03:24:38 <TheWhisper> marshmallow
03:24:40 <TheWhisper> not nyc
03:24:41 <TheWhisper> he's a canuck
03:25:02 <R0tt3n> well its a quote from a movie mainly based on graffiti
03:25:02 <marshmallow> or right
03:25:12 <TheWhisper> r0tt3n, i would've warped the photo a bit to make the pole straight vertically
03:25:14 <marshmallow> well, that's more reason i don't get it
03:25:19 <medos> TheWhisper
03:25:21 <TheWhisper> what
03:25:26 <medos> get your own shit straight
03:25:33 <TheWhisper> It is straight
03:25:34 <medos> :P
03:25:37 <TheWhisper> It's vertical as a coconut
03:25:49 <TheWhisper> I can't get it straight if I can't get patterns to work though
03:25:51 <TheWhisper> I got one to work
03:25:55 <TheWhisper> on grey
03:25:58 <R0tt3n> lol anyways medos you dont fancy the play poster? :P
03:26:00 <TheWhisper> but can't get the ones on the colors to work
03:27:16 <medos> today is no-feedback day
03:27:20 <TheWhisper> medos: http://i.imgur.com/RSsvE.png
03:27:22 <TheWhisper> I got that one to work
03:27:26 <TheWhisper> on the grey
03:27:54 <marshmallow> ] <medos> today is no-feedback day <- you give feedback on octopus but not logo =(
03:29:05 <R0tt3n> pfft, i hope tomorrow is a feedback day
03:29:12 <TheWhisper> Maybe I have to make the pattern itself in the colors I want it to be?
03:29:16 <TheWhisper> like edit the pattern file
03:29:24 <marshmallow> hey r0tt3n, what's the purpose of the graffiti poster?
03:29:49 <R0tt3n> thewhisper, whats the problem? you cant get your patterns to work on coloured objects?
03:30:03 <TheWhisper> Yeah. It changes the color of the object
03:30:09 <TheWhisper> instead of just like being a pattern over it
03:30:20 <R0tt3n> are you in illustrator?
03:30:31 <medos> no he just ignores every psd link ever
03:30:36 <medos> which might give him a hint
03:30:40 <medos> as to how people do this
03:30:43 <medos> ?psd
03:30:57 <TheWhisper> I'm reading smashing mag stuff on patterns
03:31:04 <TheWhisper> and watching method & craft videos
03:31:07 <TheWhisper> so eat your face
03:31:09 <medos> http://www.premiumpixels.com/freebies/10-dark-subtle-patterns-pat/
03:31:32 <R0tt3n> also marshmallow no real purpose, just kinda wanted to mess around with that style
03:32:20 <TheWhisper> Medos, I add those in and it still changes the color
03:32:44 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/IUkW5.png pattern on normal
03:32:59 <TheWhisper> screen http://i.imgur.com/Pptn2.png
03:33:03 <TheWhisper> it disappears on lighten
03:33:50 <TheWhisper> No blending modes make it work
03:34:51 <R0tt3n> id open the pattern in photoshop, colour range out the dark blacks so you're just left with the textured features, then put it on multiply or something like that
03:34:58 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/sXZJY.png
03:36:15 <TheWhisper> I have them in my presets?
03:36:37 <medos> no you don't
03:36:40 <medos> you could though

03:51:27 <medos> does every pro want to admit that he's been wasting endless hours of his life
03:51:32 <medos> making button after button
03:51:34 <TheWhisper> haha 
03:51:36 <medos> for each iconset?
03:51:39 <TheWhisper> true that
03:52:11 <medos> the guy who asked for that feature didn't even like my rebound :(
03:52:18 <TheWhisper> god dammit fucking textures
03:52:21 <TheWhisper> nothing i try works :(
03:57:38 <TheWhisper> medos, what were you leading into before with the presets stuff?
03:58:25 <medos> why did i show you 6 textures?
03:58:34 <medos> and not link you to subtlepatterns?
03:58:53 <medos> it's in the list of stuff to tell you now
03:59:38 <medos> and my calendar has a note for november the 3rd
03:59:41 <medos> to tell you
03:59:42 <medos> :)
04:00:00 <medos> ?whyiask
04:00:11 <TheWhisper> because they get applied differently?
04:00:48 <R0tt3n> why november?
04:01:34 <medos> because he's been asking so much basic stuff
04:01:40 <medos> and then disregarding everything relating to design
04:01:46 <medos> as soon as his homework/project is over
04:01:57 <medos> that i feel like he's good with the info in one month
04:02:44 <medos> ?freelance
04:03:10 <marshmallow> http://dribbble.com/shots/750387-Round-Corners-in-Photoshop-with-PSD  <-- boo.  cs6 =(
04:03:21 * marshmallow slaps Awesomius around a bit with a large trout
04:03:21 <TheWhisper> <medos> as soon as his homework/project is over
04:03:26 <TheWhisper> Except it's not over
04:03:31 <TheWhisper> That's the thing
04:03:38 <TheWhisper> If you had been helpful, it would have been over
04:03:45 <marshmallow> lol
04:03:51 <TheWhisper> and then I could have actually spent my time experimenting with this new knowledge
04:04:04 <TheWhisper> instead of being frustrated as fuck because I have no idea how to do shit
04:04:23 <medos> :'(((
04:04:26 <TheWhisper> ;(
04:05:04 <TheWhisper> So I assume that somehow the fact that it's an actual pattern file
04:05:10 <TheWhisper> as opposed to just like a png
04:05:13 <TheWhisper> is the difference
04:05:17 <TheWhisper> somehow
04:05:17 <TheWhisper> hm
04:06:08 <R0tt3n> medos, ive been dissecting the "check dat appearance panel" ai file and I get whats going on and everything but its just I cant wrap my mind around knowing how to get from stage 1 to the completed project
04:06:26 <TheWhisper> Do it a bunch of times
04:06:29 <TheWhisper> I had trouble with it too
04:06:47 <R0tt3n> so i guess pretty much what im trying to say is how do you know when/where to add a shade/light
04:07:06 <TheWhisper> Are you talking about the rounded corners, r0tt3n?
04:07:12 <medos> by failing for a few years and not giving up
04:07:27 <medos> ?seeing
04:07:33 <medos> ?looking
04:07:34 <medos> lele
04:07:58 <TheWhisper> I see noise
04:08:06 <TheWhisper> and I see
04:08:13 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/nUg2f.png
04:08:21 <TheWhisper> but I have no idea what those things are representing
04:08:32 <TheWhisper> I spent a half hour trying to figure that out earlier lol
04:09:14 <medos> marshmallow http://jumpshare.com/v/57E2gH
04:09:29 <medos> might not look right
04:13:22 <medos> R0tt3n i still have video material showing those buttons from start to finish
04:13:31 <medos> will render that sometime
04:13:32 <R0tt3n> are they sped up?
04:13:49 <medos> yes
04:14:15 <R0tt3n> how long would it be if you didnt speed em up? cause really i cant tell whats going on lol
04:14:45 <medos> 3-4 hours i think
04:14:52 <R0tt3n> jesus
04:21:22 <R0tt3n> aha! thats how everyone gets those nice and matte colours
04:21:28 <R0tt3n> FUCKING FILM GRAIN
04:21:31 <TheWhisper> what are you talking about, r0tt3n?
04:22:11 <medos> lol
04:22:15 <R0tt3n> in the checkdat whatever file medos's buttons were matt looking, like they looked rough 
04:22:24 <R0tt3n> and for the longest time i never knew how people pulled that off
04:22:24 <TheWhisper> What file?
04:22:29 <medos> lol
04:22:35 <medos> a file i shared a while ago
04:22:39 <R0tt3n> checkdatappearancepanel.ai
04:22:40 <medos> when you had no assignment to finish
04:22:41 <medos> :)
04:22:59 <TheWhisper> how long ago
04:23:01 <TheWhisper> is a while ago?
04:23:41 <TheWhisper> slash r0tt3n can I have the link :)
04:23:57 <R0tt3n> sure ill upload it
04:24:12 <R0tt3n> or wait it might be in
04:24:14 <R0tt3n> ?ai
04:24:14 <TheWhisper> ty
04:24:18 <R0tt3n> ?psd
04:24:24 <R0tt3n> WORK YOU ASSHOLE
04:24:47 <medos> lol
04:25:31 <TheWhisper> ooooh i see a textured color thingy
04:26:04 <R0tt3n> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/62948868/checkdatapperancepanel.ai
04:26:08 <R0tt3n> there you go
04:26:32 <TheWhisper> ty
04:27:48 <TheWhisper> dammit
04:27:52 <TheWhisper> the texture darkens the color
04:28:14 <TheWhisper> maybe i have to make the color different to start with
04:28:18 <TheWhisper> so that it ends up being the right one
04:29:31 <medos> lol
04:30:22 <TheWhisper> Please tell me :(
04:30:26 <TheWhisper> Or hint 
04:30:27 <TheWhisper> or something
04:30:28 <TheWhisper> I'm dying
04:30:44 <medos> hint: i'll tell you in 1 month
04:31:48 <R0tt3n> aw man medos would be a BRUTAL prof
04:32:17 <medos> naw
04:32:18 <medos> i was nice
04:32:20 <medos> and helpful
04:32:23 <TheWhisper> Never
04:32:25 <medos> till he stretched
04:32:27 <medos> it
04:32:33 <TheWhisper> You were always like 'cryptic hint'
04:32:39 <TheWhisper> 'that didn't really tell anything'
04:35:18 <medos> someone who tells me that my answers would be solvable by googling 10 minutes
04:35:25 <medos> should google for ten minutes
04:35:42 <medos> *his questions
04:35:43 <medos> rather
04:35:52 <TheWhisper> ?
04:35:57 <medos> ?whyiask
04:36:01 <medos> you said that ;)
04:36:02 <TheWhisper> Sigh
04:36:09 <TheWhisper> Yes, in regards to /non-design shit/
04:36:16 <TheWhisper> Which I already specified to you like 100 times
04:38:05 <R0tt3n> hey medos, what the hell is this http://i.imgur.com/0jjbG.png
04:38:27 <medos> illustrator window
04:38:30 <TheWhisper> lol
04:38:36 <TheWhisper> Is it not a radial gradient? ;)
04:39:24 <TheWhisper> hm
04:39:26 <TheWhisper> this guy puts his on
04:39:29 <TheWhisper> as pattern overlays
04:39:32 <TheWhisper> in blending options
04:39:34 <R0tt3n> GOD DAMN IT I know its a gradient within a stroke but what do i select to be able to add gradients within a stroke?
04:39:36 <TheWhisper> sets them to color burn, low opacity
04:39:47 <TheWhisper> but that still fucking changes the color
04:39:50 <TheWhisper> rkgdgkd
04:40:46 <TheWhisper> ooooh
04:40:48 <TheWhisper> this is interesting
04:41:10 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/5v0BU.png
04:41:20 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/M03zR.png
04:41:22 <TheWhisper> the light green is the same
04:42:14 <TheWhisper> The only problem is this is just a noise pattern
04:42:21 <TheWhisper> And I wanted a more textured one
04:42:21 <TheWhisper> hm
04:43:51 <TheWhisper> it's pure black and white
04:44:02 <TheWhisper> medos do the patterns need to be b&w?
04:48:35 <R0tt3n> when you're messing around with the gradient tool in illustrator does where you put the line and circle thing have to be precise?

04:49:16 <marshmallow>  <medos> marshmallow http://jumpshare.com/v/57E2gH <-- thanks, i'll look at it at work.  cs4 at home.  cs5 at work.
04:50:06 <TheWhisper> I feel like I'm going to throw my window out of itself
04:50:34 <medos> why?
04:50:41 <medos> because you have to figure stuff out yourself?
04:50:44 <TheWhisper> No
04:50:49 <TheWhisper> I'm fine with that
04:51:00 <TheWhisper> Just the process of figuring out is frustrating :)
04:51:05 <TheWhisper> Rewarding, of course
04:51:12 <TheWhisper> Yet frustrating
04:52:24 <R0tt3n> medos are there any hotkeys when working with the gradient tool in ai? is there anything i can do/hold to make it like snap to 90, 180 degrees?
04:52:42 <TheWhisper> Shift?
04:53:05 <R0tt3n> tried shift
04:53:18 <TheWhisper> hm
04:53:19 <TheWhisper> what if i
04:53:24 <TheWhisper> do a hue saturation

04:55:24 <medos> good night man
04:56:07 <TheWhisper> later
04:56:08 <TheWhisper> oops
04:56:14 <TheWhisper> hm
04:56:20 <TheWhisper> doing a hue saturation
04:56:24 <TheWhisper> could have potential to work
05:02:10 <TheWhisper> omg
05:02:20 <EDSGD> ugh
05:02:33 <EDSGD> so I figured it out.
05:03:25 <EDSGD> So i was going to do the annual report for the company that does the The North face
05:03:35 <EDSGD> and their shit is only 25 pages 
05:04:48 <TheWhisper> omg
05:04:59 <TheWhisper> with texture: http://i.imgur.com/6yOEY.png
05:05:10 <TheWhisper> without: http://i.imgur.com/JaYs3.png
05:05:20 <TheWhisper> I think I defeated the purpose of the texture though
05:06:51 <TheWhisper> hm
05:06:56 <TheWhisper> yu can still see it though
05:06:57 <TheWhisper> just very slightly
05:08:20 <TheWhisper> medos now that I figured it out
05:08:26 <TheWhisper> can you tell me if that was the right way
05:08:27 <TheWhisper> ?
05:09:02 <EDSGD> I can't even see the texture.
05:09:10 <medos> ^
05:09:12 <medos> lelele
05:09:13 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:09:17 <TheWhisper> because shitty screenshot
05:09:43 <TheWhisper> I'll show you
05:10:15 <marshmallow> yo, can one of you say marshmallow.  i'm testing a script
05:10:35 <TheWhisper> marshmallow
05:10:40 <EDSGD> marshmallow. i'm testing a script
05:10:51 <marshmallow> oooh, that works
05:10:54 <marshmallow> okies =D
05:11:14 <TheWhisper> this one is no texture: https://www.dropbox.com/s/h2kfo5sbqib2cuy/notexture.png
05:11:17 <marshmallow> it's just an alert so I can hear it and see what time you bug me

05:13:07 <zakmac> Where's the texture?
05:13:15 <EDSGD> ^ This
05:13:42 <TheWhisper> on the shelf thing
05:13:46 <TheWhisper> in the center
05:13:50 <zakmac> Nope
05:13:57 <TheWhisper> yup
05:14:13 <TheWhisper> zoom in more if you can't see it
05:14:15 <TheWhisper> anyway
05:14:16 <TheWhisper> maybe
05:14:22 <zakmac> Then its so subtle it doesn't matter, with or without it looks fine
05:14:26 <TheWhisper> maybe it's not possible to keep the color the same with applying a texture?
05:14:37 <zakmac> Oh now I see
05:14:42 <zakmac> Dear god that's minute
05:14:46 <TheWhisper> lol
05:14:48 <TheWhisper> Wel
05:14:53 <TheWhisper> You missed the whole thing
05:14:57 <TheWhisper> I want to apply a texture
05:15:02 <TheWhisper> but not have the color of the bg itself change
05:15:06 <TheWhisper> well
05:15:09 <TheWhisper> not change majorly
05:15:15 <TheWhisper> and anytime I apply a texture
05:15:26 <TheWhisper> I can't get the color to be what I want
05:15:28 <zakmac> Overly+low opacity
05:15:33 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:15:34 <zakmac> Overlay*
05:15:37 <TheWhisper> but then I change the color
05:15:38 <TheWhisper> :(
05:15:54 <zakmac> Nah, overlay looks decently textured down to 3-5%
05:18:23 <marshmallow> hmr..
05:19:11 <marshmallow> how about.. take the texture layer + layer adjustment.  saturate it.
05:19:20 <marshmallow> then put the texture layer and set at soft light
05:20:41 <TheWhisper> the textures are disappearing
05:20:44 <TheWhisper> at like 20 percent
05:21:25 <TheWhisper> and then if I get them to a stage where they're visible
05:21:29 <TheWhisper> they've changed the color a ton
05:23:09 <TheWhisper> Yeah, zakmac, it just doesn't work
05:24:24 <TheWhisper> and marshmallow
05:24:28 <TheWhisper> can't get that working either
05:24:29 <TheWhisper> :(
05:26:29 <marshmallow> http://i.imgur.com/m5dvA.jpg
05:26:29 <marshmallow> try my way =D
05:26:29 <marshmallow> http://i.imgur.com/m5dvA.jpg
05:26:32 <marshmallow> what are the images?
05:26:32 <medos> cs4 looks like that ? D:
05:26:39 <marshmallow> sorry?
05:27:23 <marshmallow> you set the texture layer to soft light right?
05:27:25 * marshmallow shrugs
05:27:27 <TheWhisper> hm marshmallow what is the saturation
05:27:31 <TheWhisper> set to
05:27:44 <marshmallow> full
05:27:46 <marshmallow> -100
05:28:15 <marshmallow> if you saturate the shit out of your texture, you won't get much color problems. =D
05:29:54 <TheWhisper> Nope, still doesn't work :(
05:30:05 <TheWhisper> wait
05:30:13 <TheWhisper> is it fully saturated
05:30:17 <TheWhisper> or fully desaturated
05:30:52 <zakmac> I desaturate and then blow out bright/con
05:31:03 <zakmac> Generally speaking
05:31:11 <marshmallow> but it too all grey
05:31:14 <marshmallow> *put it
05:31:15 <TheWhisper> oooh
05:31:18 <TheWhisper> so desaturated
05:31:19 <marshmallow> *put it to all grey
05:31:22 <marshmallow> sorry, mai bad
05:31:58 <marshmallow> then set texture layer to soft light 100%
05:32:33 <TheWhisper> omg zakmac 
05:32:34 <TheWhisper> that worked

05:42:04 <TheWhisper> 4 hours
05:42:05 <TheWhisper> ;(

05:42:53 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Y2hTZ.png
05:43:06 <medos> i'm like
05:43:15 <medos> why do i have to tell him when he can just open one of my psd files

05:43:26 <medos> repeatedly
05:43:32 <medos> and other people too
05:43:35 <medos> which counts as
05:43:42 <TheWhisper> I looked
05:43:43 <TheWhisper> in 
05:43:43 <medos> trying to help
05:43:48 <TheWhisper> like 10 psds
05:44:18 <marshmallow> zakmac, can you tell what it is?
05:44:27 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/nObWQ.png ?
05:44:29 <medos> this one
05:45:24 <TheWhisper> I looked through http://i.imgur.com/9skaA.png those
05:45:28 <zakmac> A sword, marshmallow ?
05:45:39 <marshmallow> no >_<
05:45:44 <zakmac> A ribbon?
05:45:50 <marshmallow> >_<;;
05:46:04 <zakmac> Well ribbon was my first guess but then I saw a pirate sword
05:46:09 <zakmac> What it be?
05:46:16 <zakmac> A "Y"?
05:46:22 <TheWhisper> and then these: http://i.imgur.com/7banC.png
05:46:22 <marshmallow> half right =D
05:46:30 <zakmac> A "y"?
05:46:38 <zakmac> ;
05:46:39 <TheWhisper> and these http://i.imgur.com/rjMeA.png
05:46:43 <marshmallow> half right =D
05:46:48 <zakmac> That was a wink
05:47:03 <marshmallow> and is half right ^_^
05:47:31 <marshmallow> hoopla!
05:47:34 <medos> http://jumpshare.com/v/e7E2EF ?
05:48:19 <TheWhisper> yes: http://i.imgur.com/iuQFN.png
05:48:21 <marshmallow> it's also a "p"
05:48:23 <TheWhisper> that was in my first screenshot
05:48:30 <marshmallow> since that's his other initial
05:48:47 <TheWhisper> come on, medos. don't just look. /see/
05:48:49 <TheWhisper> lolol
05:49:13 <marshmallow> anyway, I think it'll be clearer when I add the text -.-;;
05:49:27 <marshmallow> otherwise it's a sword/ribbon.  haha. 
05:49:46 <EDSGD> wtf seeing steve buscemi have sex in weird
05:49:52 <medos> D:D:D:

05:50:18 <marshmallow> anyway, gnite.  i need sleep
05:50:39 <medos> TheWhisper there is plenty of it
05:50:49 <TheWhisper> I don't see any in it
05:50:52 <TheWhisper> no textures
05:51:05 <TheWhisper> Tons of shadows and glows though
05:51:38 <EDSGD> sfw http://imgur.com/UjRML
05:52:26 <TheWhisper> yeah, there's 0 textures in here
05:52:33 <medos> brush
05:53:16 <TheWhisper> well
05:53:17 <TheWhisper> somehow
05:53:18 <TheWhisper> he
05:53:29 <TheWhisper> did a texture using an inner shadow?
05:53:46 <TheWhisper> wtf
05:53:53 <TheWhisper> ooooh
05:53:54 <TheWhisper> duh
05:53:55 <TheWhisper> using the noise
05:53:56 <TheWhisper> wow
05:53:59 <TheWhisper> I fail
05:54:00 <TheWhisper> but yeah
05:54:06 * zakmac sucks at this
05:54:09 <TheWhisper> I don't see any texturing besides that on the background
05:55:38 <TheWhisper> I really ike that he uses the noise in the glows/shadows though
05:55:45 <EDSGD> YAY
05:55:46 <TheWhisper> Never thought of that (even though it's so damn obvious
05:55:47 <TheWhisper> )
05:55:56 <EDSGD> Im getting the IBM annual report
05:56:00 <EDSGD> :D
05:56:05 <TheWhisper> I Butt Munch
05:57:20 <medos> so that file has texture now?
05:57:23 <medos> agree with me?
05:57:44 <TheWhisper> Insofar as using noise is texture, yes
05:57:53 <medos> good
05:57:56 <TheWhisper> But no like actual texture files
05:57:59 <TheWhisper> or subtlepatterns things
05:58:04 <medos> thank you for seeing the whole thing less like a push-button
05:58:06 <medos> and more like
05:58:10 <zakmac> Noise is one of the most effective textures
05:58:13 <TheWhisper> True
05:58:16 <TheWhisper> And I use noise
05:58:18 <TheWhisper> In my site
05:58:23 <zakmac> I make my own dissolve textures with white/black all the damn time
05:58:25 <TheWhisper> Maybe not enough tough
05:58:29 <TheWhisper> *though
05:58:29 <TheWhisper> but
05:58:31 <zakmac> And blur to my heart's content
05:58:34 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:58:37 <medos> fuck blur
05:58:44 <medos> feather :D
05:58:58 <TheWhisper> http://i.minus.com/ibgq6HL3Wn28z.png 
05:59:23 <TheWhisper> I think those textures on the sides and shelf are too similar :(
05:59:44 <TheWhisper> also the photo seems to have disappeared
05:59:44 <TheWhisper> wtf
06:00:00 <TheWhisper> Ah, still there on the psd. good
06:01:55 <TheWhisper> medos is it still really ugly to you?
06:07:12 <medos> it has appeal
06:07:25 <medos> in a mc-donalds-drop-down-order-menu kind of sense
06:07:46 <TheWhisper> hm
06:07:49 <TheWhisper> mc-donalds
06:07:51 <TheWhisper> who says that
06:07:51 <TheWhisper> lol
06:07:55 <TheWhisper> so
06:07:57 <TheWhisper> it has appeal

06:19:07 <medos> yeah
06:19:15 <TheWhisper> It looks like a tadpole with wings
06:19:40 <TheWhisper> you should dribbble it
06:20:04 <Kocho> yeah
06:20:06 <Kocho> bbb it
06:20:13 <TheWhisper> damn

06:20:26 <TheWhisper> it's a keyboard
06:20:29 <TheWhisper> still cool
06:20:34 <TheWhisper> but not as cool as i thought it was
06:20:35 <TheWhisper> lol
06:21:22 <TheWhisper> Medos, why'd you comment 'hi reddit' on that fliptape thing?
06:21:29 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/WdsZ5.jpg
06:21:53 <Kocho> fields look too dark zakmac 
06:22:05 <TheWhisper> yah
06:22:14 <zakmac> Dammit I've been making them lighter all day
06:22:14 <TheWhisper> I liked the last version you showed a bit better
06:22:33 <TheWhisper> i think the last version you showed /was/ darker
06:22:39 <TheWhisper> but it seemed lighter for some reason too
06:23:08 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/R5sjf.png
06:23:11 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/amlDX.png
06:23:32 <TheWhisper> yeah
06:23:34 <TheWhisper> I liked that better
06:23:48 <medos> Kocho http://i.imgur.com/EJFtY.png <- that's what i linked zak to 24h ago
06:23:54 <medos> saying it needs to be BRIGHTER
06:24:01 <TheWhisper> I think also a middleground between the two blurs would be good 
06:24:05 <TheWhisper> the old one is too blurry
06:24:05 <zakmac> I will do no such thing
06:24:09 <TheWhisper> but the new one is not blurry enough
06:24:09 <Kocho> yeah make it brighter
06:24:24 <Kocho> make it the colour of that sign in button
06:24:32 <TheWhisper> oh lol medos nice
06:24:59 <TheWhisper> The old woody version
06:25:01 <TheWhisper> feels more inviting
06:25:04 <TheWhisper> the new one
06:25:08 <TheWhisper> is sort of cold
06:25:10 <TheWhisper> with no depth
06:25:11 <zakmac> Its warmer :(
06:25:14 <TheWhisper> it feels like a wall in my face
06:25:20 <TheWhisper> while the woody one is like
06:25:29 <TheWhisper> 'come put your characters in my slots and then press my buttons'
06:25:57 <medos> good analysis of a 3 minute mock up
06:26:06 <medos> to show that zak's login form is too dark
06:26:17 <TheWhisper> warm and inviting = too dark?
06:26:22 <TheWhisper> or the cold one = too dark?
06:26:43 <medos> if he would show the actual website
06:26:51 <zakmac> www.5minmystery.com
06:26:53 <medos> it would be obvious that the wooden planks do not fit at all
06:26:57 <TheWhisper> no
06:26:59 <TheWhisper> the new version
06:27:04 <TheWhisper> not the old one
06:27:16 <TheWhisper> http://www.5minutemystery.com/images/bg-nav.png lol medos
06:27:20 <TheWhisper> but that's the old one, ofc
06:27:26 <TheWhisper> SHOW US THE NEW ONE
06:27:30 <TheWhisper> I haven't seen it since like
06:27:34 <medos> it looks great
06:27:35 <TheWhisper> june/july
06:27:47 <medos> but not really anything like it would be preceeded by wooden login forms
06:27:55 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/jc3Vu.png
06:28:05 <TheWhisper> Oh wow
06:28:10 <TheWhisper> that's a lot different than the last one I saw
06:28:18 <zakmac> wip
06:28:20 <TheWhisper> wait
06:28:22 <TheWhisper> lemme see
06:28:27 <TheWhisper> the game page itself
06:28:39 <medos> to me that looks more like the login should be paper-esque / a hotel keychain
06:29:03 <TheWhisper> "sign in to the hotel california"
06:29:09 <TheWhisper> "once you log in, you can never sign out!"
06:29:39 <TheWhisper> zakmac, do you still have a copy of the older version from around june?
06:29:51 <zakmac> http://www.zakmac.com/5mm/
06:30:01 <TheWhisper> hm
06:30:05 <TheWhisper> not as good as I remembered it haha
06:30:11 <TheWhisper> I remember it being much warmer
06:30:19 <TheWhisper> with more rounding on the edges and stuff
06:30:20 <TheWhisper> weird
06:30:25 <zakmac> That's what yer mother said
06:30:47 <TheWhisper> What does the current game page look like?
06:30:57 <zakmac> Not there yet
06:31:15 <TheWhisper> k
06:31:21 <zakmac> It will end up looking Moleskine-esque I think
06:32:08 <medos> .gis wooden moleskine
06:32:09 <TheWhisper> "As a courtesy to all clients, public-facing previews are kept at a low resolution."
06:32:18 <TheWhisper> "because uploading images takes a long time, suck it"
06:32:25 <TheWhisper> also, lol
06:32:27 <TheWhisper> that's a cat
06:32:31 <zakmac> Because I lack inspiration to design an actual portfolio *
06:32:48 <TheWhisper> make it a moleskin
06:32:49 <TheWhisper> e
06:33:02 <TheWhisper> ew
06:33:09 <TheWhisper> do not do a .gis for moleskin
06:33:10 <TheWhisper> ew
06:33:34 <TheWhisper> and I mean 'moleskin'. Not skine
06:33:37 <zakmac> I hate other designers. Then I see one had an idea like mine and think "Fuck that, they're a douche and I don't want to come off anything like them" 
06:33:46 <zakmac> then I realize I suck and it wouldn't look as good anyway
06:33:59 <TheWhisper> probs
06:34:14 <TheWhisper> like you could never pull of anything like my website
06:34:17 <TheWhisper> too niche for you
06:34:23 <TheWhisper> in terms of failure level
06:34:40 <zakmac> I could slam that out in hours
06:34:46 <zakmac> And code it overnight, son
06:34:48 <TheWhisper> oooh i get it
06:34:50 <TheWhisper> You should
06:34:52 <TheWhisper> make the login
06:34:53 <zakmac> Because that's how players do
06:34:58 <TheWhisper> in holmes' mouth
06:35:02 <TheWhisper> :)
06:36:17 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/Yx7kC.jpg
06:36:41 <TheWhisper> pretty much
06:36:55 <TheWhisper> you should get the rights to use Benedict Cumberbatch's image
06:37:01 <TheWhisper> I'd visit yor site then

06:38:04 <zakmac> I am strangely attracted to that guy
06:38:12 <zakmac> I think its because he's so ugly
06:38:52 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/dB7Iy.jpg
06:38:54 <TheWhisper> wat
06:39:00 <TheWhisper> he's very attractive imo
06:39:01 <zakmac> Haha
06:39:05 <TheWhisper> wait
06:39:07 <zakmac> He is absolutely not
06:39:07 <TheWhisper> yeah
06:39:12 <TheWhisper> he actually is really fucking weird looking
06:39:19 <TheWhisper> but very magnetic too
06:39:41 <zakmac> From a distance he looks possibly handsome. Give it any bit of a good look though and BAM, weirdo
06:40:11 <zakmac> This lock icon sucks dick
06:40:19 <zakmac> This whole thing sucks dick
06:40:22 <zakmac> New project
06:40:48 <TheWhisper> I think it's his charisma
06:40:52 <TheWhisper> Did you watch sherlock?
06:40:57 <TheWhisper> *have you watched
06:41:28 <zakmac> Yes. Don't you ever question that fact again
06:41:40 <zakmac> Have you seen season 2

06:42:07 <TheWhisper> I was heartbroken still though
06:42:08 <TheWhisper> for john
06:42:10 <zakmac> And season 3 NEEDS TO EXPLAIN SOME SHIT
06:42:24 <TheWhisper> I sort of knew that he wasn't out of the picture though
06:42:28 <TheWhisper> because of the episode name

15:23:34 <adding_confusion> i am dealing with a major billboard company that just tried to use an attached screenshot as the design file.. Even with the AI and PDF right there in the same folder.
15:24:50 <adding_confusion> and they are saying that the file size needs to be at least 2mb to work.. WTF are they talking about? Its a simple vector billboard. I cant just make the filesize bigger!!?!
15:36:20 <medos> lol
15:36:25 <medos> you're too efficient
15:37:55 <medos> add a few livetraces
15:38:08 <medos> and hide a layer with a few tiff images in the file
15:39:23 <marshmallow> so medos..  I followed your guide
15:39:28 <marshmallow> the round corners thingy
15:39:44 <medos> awesome
15:39:44 <marshmallow> Step 5 to Step Dance...
15:39:48 <marshmallow> so not the same
15:39:55 <marshmallow> *step 6
15:40:05 <medos> lol
15:40:16 <medos> mind showing me how the file looks in cs5?
15:40:24 <medos> i added quite a bit of cs 6 trickery
15:40:38 <marshmallow> screenshot it?
15:40:40 <marshmallow> or save it?
15:40:50 <medos> good question
15:40:59 <medos> tl;dr: does it look like the dribbble shot when you open it?
15:41:24 <marshmallow> errr.  relink the dribbble link?
15:42:39 <medos> w8
15:42:41 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/GQ3kv.png
15:42:42 <medos> easier
15:43:49 <medos> also: step 6 is the last step of the guide/tutorial
15:44:13 <medos> whatever happens after it can have any name i want
15:44:26 <marshmallow> eh, looks the same
15:44:30 <medos> weird
15:45:02 <marshmallow> step 6 to Dance is like this: http://www.survivedavis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/owl.jpg
15:45:22 <medos> lol
15:45:47 <medos> exactly
15:46:02 <medos> 1. make some rounded corner buttons
15:46:21 <medos> 2. style them pixel perfect with lighting pattern and shadow/transparency effects
15:47:39 <medos> those buttons aren't even special :(
15:48:45 <medos> marshmallow did you watch the video?
15:48:57 <marshmallow> oh no
15:48:58 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0F9ZN8oXFA&feature=youtu.be&hd=1
15:49:56 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0F9ZN8oXFA&feature=player_detailpage#t=225s <<- the trick behind this
15:50:25 <medos> (same video just starting @ specific time)
15:56:59 <marshmallow> oooooooooooooooooh, i get it now
15:57:19 <marshmallow> you just use illy to get the rectangle shapes.  but all the coloring/effects is photoshop
15:57:22 <marshmallow> gar
15:57:25 <medos> yes
15:57:44 <medos> imagine you make an iconset with 40 icons
15:57:47 <marshmallow> i was like..  how did you do the coloring effects in illy if they're 4 different fills.  gah
15:57:47 <medos> each icon being a box
15:58:18 <medos> now you want the same thing with circles
15:58:40 <medos> one smart object to rule them all :O
15:58:52 <TheWhisper> lugh fuck me i totally overslept
16:01:05 <TheWhisper> hey zakmac http://i.imgur.com/z4XbA.png i don't think you're taking into account the fuel necessary to achieve escape velocity
16:02:19 <marshmallow> ^^ LOL!  For that price, I would totally drive a car to to moon.  super cheap
16:02:25 <marshmallow> *to the moon
16:03:00 <marshmallow> <medos> one smart object to rule them all :O <- I guess that works
16:04:00 <adding_confusion> @medos love the idea of hiding some layers in there
16:04:03 <medos> i would've left too

16:05:51 <medos> either way, both filetypes support pattern/swatches/brushes/symbols
16:05:56 <adding_confusion> it was an AI file.. I ended up resubmitting the artwork as a PSD and I think its all good now
16:06:03 <medos> just fill your symbol library to the max
16:06:03 <medos> ah
16:06:25 <TheWhisper> abysmol library
16:06:49 <adding_confusion> @medos is that screenshot CS6? dark skin is default, right?

16:13:18 <TheWhisper> Marshmallow, do you think it is demeaning to lesbians when straight girls are 'married' to their BFFs on FB/
16:13:56 <marshmallow> it's okay if you're in college or younger
16:14:01 <marshmallow> not really after college though
16:14:08 <marshmallow> people might seriously start thinking you're married
16:14:32 <marshmallow> my friend is "married" to a guy on facebook (who is gay) and her first day of grad school people were like "so... you're married?"
16:14:53 <medos> in the past it was a ring
16:14:59 <medos> nowadays it's the fb status
16:15:55 <marshmallow> well, they were more like "where's the ring???"
16:17:25 <marshmallow> btw, the "husband" is openly gay.  so it's not like he's using this status to hide his choice
16:17:51 <marshmallow> so overally, no, I do not think it's demeaning to lesbians
16:25:29 <marshmallow> TheWhisper...  Revolution got a full season one order!  (not surprised.  but yay!)
16:25:36 <medos> .tv revolution
16:26:55 <marshmallow> =D
16:27:26 <medos> .seen tv
16:27:31 <medos> me neither
16:27:46 <marshmallow> essentially Monday's @ 10p.  No way will they skip (or should) skip a week since we're in fall sweeps =D
16:32:56 <TheWhisper> marshmallow, yeah, 3rd episode was really levels above the first two
16:33:24 <marshmallow> yea, it's stabilized-ish
16:33:36 <marshmallow> doesn't matter.  anything higher then 2.5 is friggin amazing at 10p
16:33:43 <marshmallow> and it was like 3.1
16:33:47 <marshmallow> or something like that
16:34:50 <marshmallow> & compared to the other NBC new shows..  revolution is the best =D
16:35:44 <TheWhisper> I just hope it can keep it up
16:35:51 <TheWhisper> The last show was written by a person who had workedo n Lost
16:35:54 <TheWhisper> and is a good writer
16:38:19 <TheWhisper> Being able to change my mouse's DPI when tracing things with pen tool = awesome

16:51:11 <zakmac> Ohh dithered gradients are nice
16:51:26 <TheWhisper> Essentially it remaps blacks to = darkest gradient color

19:35:55 <marshmallow> <medos> try to present them a little more gracefully <- ??  in the end, the guy is gonna use them just as watermarks on photos
19:36:11 <marshmallow> so, it is how it would be
19:36:49 <medos> opacity 80 %
19:36:52 <medos> slight drop shadow
19:36:55 <medos> or blur
19:37:04 <medos> and one white variation on black and one black variation on white
19:37:09 <medos> then you throw all of that in .eps files
19:37:20 <medos> so you have two at least
19:37:27 <medos> and teach him some batch-img-fu
19:37:31 <medos> i guess he knows that already
19:37:51 <medos> opacity 90%
19:37:56 <medos> 95
19:37:58 <medos> 90 or 95
19:38:03 <medos> not 100
19:38:24 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/xtB8X.png
19:39:42 <marshmallow> er..  hokies -.-
19:39:56 <medos> what if he shoots a night scene?
19:40:17 <medos> it'll look like someone in the lower right corner is shouting "yee"
19:40:29 <marshmallow> then white becomes black and vice versa
19:40:50 <adding_confusion> top right looks the cleanest most modern i think
19:40:57 <marshmallow> just wondering if i should continue building different logos, or if i have a winner anywhere
19:41:57 <marshmallow> thanks for your feedback =D
19:42:04 <marshmallow> anything you wanna add? =D
19:44:36 <adding_confusion> i like the idea of mixing the y and the p but i think it mixes wierdly with the font on the example i saw
19:45:12 <adding_confusion> what are the charactors, is that peter yee's name?
19:45:32 <marshmallow> it means masterpiece in chinese
19:45:49 <adding_confusion> all the lowercase e's look like people smiling
19:45:54 <marshmallow> his current logo uses it
19:46:49 <medos> smilee
19:46:59 <adding_confusion> I always see the red stamp with the chinese charactors in it on different art pieces, can you work it in red maybe?
19:47:48 <adding_confusion> hard to see it but in this one
19:47:48 <marshmallow> red stamp?
19:48:12 <medos> .gis chinese red ink
19:48:37 <marshmallow> oooooooh
19:48:52 <marshmallow> hmr, I can make it an option
19:49:05 <adding_confusion> the top right option just reminds me of it a little
19:49:54 <adding_confusion> the bottom left there would have to be a differentiation with the name and the studios so he doesnt look like peter yeest
19:50:31 <adding_confusion> awesomius is awesome
19:50:47 <adding_confusion> .make marshmallow a logo
19:50:54 <marshmallow> YEA!  make me a logo!
19:51:08 <adding_confusion> maybe it takes a minute
19:51:31 <marshmallow> lol
19:55:09 <zakmac> marshmallow: I don't like the font choices on PYS that you've offered
19:55:29 <marshmallow> on all of them?
19:55:36 <zakmac> Yupyup
19:55:37 <marshmallow> what's a good alternative font =D
19:55:44 <marshmallow> not gonna lie, I was having a hard time with the fonts
19:55:46 <zakmac> Bottom right is best, but not awesomesauce
19:56:53 <medos> http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Amechanical/fonts/
19:58:22 <marshmallow> le sigh
19:59:49 <medos> din 1451, swiss 721,
20:00:02 <medos> interstate?
20:00:51 <marshmallow> yar, one is interstate
20:00:54 <marshmallow> top left
20:01:39 <medos> myriad
20:02:28 <marshmallow> nope
20:02:40 <medos> i was giving random recommendations
20:02:42 <medos> :P
20:02:46 <marshmallow> oooh
20:02:53 <marshmallow> i thought you were guessing them -.-
20:03:06 <marshmallow> din 1451, swiss 721, <-- was that a suggestion or a guess?
20:03:16 <medos> suggestion
20:03:26 <medos> swiss cndnsd
20:03:32 <medos> *condensed
20:06:25 <marshmallow> gotchya
20:10:07 <zakmac> Incredibly half-asses $.02 because I'm busy at work: http://i.imgur.com/X94ap.png
20:10:44 <zakmac> I'd highly suggest using something beyond a default AI brush, but you get the idea
20:12:04 <medos> looks like the ring

22:33:22 <cal> source looks so good on csgo
22:34:19 <cal> how do you go about finding consistent work?
22:35:28 <medos> not playing csgo would be a good start
22:35:58 <medos> then there's never consistent freelance work just consistent tries with a consistent margin of clients that like you
22:36:16 <cal> yeah
22:36:20 <cal> csgo is just sooo fun
22:36:21 <cal> hahahaha
22:36:43 <cal> right now I just do graphic work for spare change, being 16 and whatnot
22:37:27 <medos> can't really give any advice for that kind of situation
22:37:42 <medos> sounds like you don't mind too much either
22:38:14 <cal> lol true
22:40:06 <medos> stick to the spare change thing, if it's fun and you figure it out you still have enough time to get serious about it
22:40:15 <cal> yup
22:40:24 <cal> I might minor in it. dunno
22:40:30 <cal> i'm for sure going into audio engineering

22:46:38 <adding_confusion> re freelance: I think it helps to get a client or two that need ongoing work
22:46:55 <adding_confusion> or to get on a design firms short list of freelancers for overflow work
22:47:09 <cal> that's a pretty rad idea
22:47:10 <adding_confusion> how easy that is... im not sure
22:48:07 <cal> do you guys ever get any local work?

23:36:43 <TheWhisper> vs grubhub?
23:36:46 <zm> I knows the nose noes
23:37:36 <zm> Never used it. Went with E24H because their fee was almost non-existent. But its crazy slow and the minimum order amounts should shame any non-paralyzed fatass into shlubbing into their car and picking it up themselves
23:38:19 <TheWhisper> hm
23:38:25 <zm> But its a good way to get delivery form a place that doesn't, so meh
23:38:26 <TheWhisper> e24h doesn't have a fee thouh
23:38:28 <TheWhisper> and neither does grubhub
23:38:41 <zm> I'll look at GH then
23:39:00 <zm> And yes they have a "fee" if you check the menu from where you order it becomes apparent its built into the cost

23:39:32 <TheWhisper> they deliver themselve
23:39:35 <TheWhisper> *themselves
23:39:39 <TheWhisper> grubhub doesn't deliver for them or anything
23:39:50 <TheWhisper> and some places /do/ have delivery fees for themselves
23:39:57 <TheWhisper> but each one is different
23:40:00 <TheWhisper> some have no fee
23:40:04 <TheWhisper> some have like 4 buck fee
23:40:07 <zm> So confusing

23:41:35 <zm> GrubHub UI sucks a dick. Slam my choices into the left column 20 at a time
23:41:40 <TheWhisper> Yup
23:41:44 <medos> lol
23:41:53 <zm> That makes this 221 item list a *blast* to peruse
23:41:55 <TheWhisper> I don't even know what they're trying to go for
23:42:02 <TheWhisper> "oh your website is a bunch of ripped pieces of paper? cool'
23:42:03 <medos> you're lucky you can see their login form
23:42:12 <TheWhisper> You can't?
23:42:14 <zm> They have a login form?
23:42:27 <TheWhisper> oh
23:42:27 <medos> sidejab failed
23:42:28 <TheWhisper> it's tiny

23:42:52 <zm> Jesus
23:43:05 <TheWhisper> campusfood.com
23:43:10 <TheWhisper> used to be much better
23:43:14 <TheWhisper> but then grubhub bought them

23:45:39 <TheWhisper> Was not great by any means
23:45:42 <TheWhisper> but much easier to use than grubhub

23:46:41 <TheWhisper> that's what their restaurant listing looked like
23:46:44 <TheWhisper> much better imo
23:47:08 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/O4RtG.png
23:47:47 <medos> 1 day
23:47:49 <medos> good job

23:49:10 <zm> Chilling
23:50:02 <TheWhisper> medos, 1 day what?
23:51:22 <zm> Rape, he will rape you
23:51:22 <TheWhisper> :)
23:51:22 <TheWhisper> hm
23:51:22 <zm> Ah map view, slightly less sucky if you know the location of every restaurant near you
23:51:22 <TheWhisper> I wonder if it's even worth watching the debate
23:51:22 <TheWhisper> I doubt anything interesting will be shown
23:51:23 <TheWhisper> or discussed
23:51:23 <zm> http://hollywoodtheatre.org/presidential-debate-hecklevison/
23:51:23 <TheWhisper> and it'll probably just make me angry
23:51:23 <zm> Yes, yes it is

23:53:29 <zm> I was excited to be a fatty for dinner tonight. Now I am just like a Tea Partier, fat and disgruntled
23:53:40 <zm> And a little bit hungry
23:54:05 <TheWhisper> I need to buy a bike
23:54:12 <TheWhisper> Walking takes sooo long
23:54:21 <TheWhisper> Even though I walk fast
23:54:25 <TheWhisper> It still ends up being too long
23:54:29 <zm> http://itunes.apple.com/app/grubhub-food-delivery-takeout/id302920553?mt=8
23:54:30 <zm> good god
23:54:31 <TheWhisper> and I'm all sweaty if I'm in a rush
23:54:41 <TheWhisper> hm
23:54:51 <TheWhisper> I think I should emulate them more in my site
23:55:14 <zm> Yes, channel GrubHub sense of usability, please
23:55:18 <TheWhisper> Any suggestions for a good bike?
23:55:39 <TheWhisper> that is not a fixie or w.e
23:56:02 <TheWhisper> http://bikeloft.com/product/12specialized-s-works-mclaren-venge-130904-1.htm this one looks nice and cheap
23:57:11 <zm> I rock the Diamondback Response
23:57:17 <zm> 2009 model I believe
23:57:48 <IAmLegend> how much$$$ TheWhisper?
23:58:04 <zm> It's awesome except my derailer is a hunk of junk and needs replaced like whoa
23:58:16 <TheWhisper> iamlegend, look at the price on the site
23:58:23 <IAmLegend> do you want to spend..
23:58:24 <zm> And I have a granny death because this OG rides in luxury or not at all
23:58:33 <TheWhisper> oh
23:58:34 <TheWhisper> lol
23:58:37 <TheWhisper> 100~ 
23:58:42 <TheWhisper> :(
23:58:44 <zm> Granny seat* WHAT-THE-FUCK OSX
23:58:55 <IAmLegend> $100 for a bike? second hand and basic is where you'd be at
23:59:03 <IAmLegend> hybrid bikes are a good starter ;)
23:59:14 <zm> Good thing Steve Jobs died because I would send him a letter bomb for this spell checker if he was still around
23:59:15 <TheWhisper> zakmac, why not http://i.imgur.com/wxPSl.jpg
23:59:40 <zm> Sorry, I'm from a strange family I guess. That *is* what I meant
