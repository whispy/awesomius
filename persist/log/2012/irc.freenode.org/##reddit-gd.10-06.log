16:15:43 <TheWhisper> That's why, apparently
16:16:43 <medos> lemme guess
16:16:47 <medos> you have noscript running?
16:17:19 <TheWhisper> Yes, but not for wa
16:17:25 <TheWhisper> It's only blocking sharethis.com on wa
16:17:43 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/og99M.png
16:18:00 <medos> turn noscript off

16:19:04 <medos> no
16:19:09 <medos> use a browser without plugins
16:19:13 <medos> go private session
16:19:18 <medos> then open wa again
16:19:33 <TheWhisper> What are we trying to figure out?
16:20:04 <medos> i'm trying to explain to you why the bot can not under any circumstance pull results from WA
16:20:21 <medos> you're supposed to go no-plugin wolfram alpha
16:20:30 <medos> copy paste the result of 300 eur in usd
16:20:41 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/Y3yD0.png
16:20:46 <TheWhisper> Oh yeah
16:20:49 <TheWhisper> That stupid thing they have
16:21:12 <medos> it's not stupid
16:21:19 <TheWhisper> Well, for them it's not.
16:21:25 <medos> it's you not accounting for the lowest common denominator
16:21:28 <TheWhisper> Lol
16:21:29 <medos> like always
16:21:31 <TheWhisper> It's not the LCD
16:21:33 <medos> erryday
16:21:37 <TheWhisper> It's them 1) trying to get registered users
16:21:50 <TheWhisper> and 2) making it so if people want to use data from WA in their sites/bots/etc
16:21:52 <TheWhisper> they need to register
16:21:59 <TheWhisper> Completely makes sense for WA to have it
16:22:12 <TheWhisper> Annoying (though only slightly) for users
16:22:21 <TheWhisper> It's not by any means a LCD thing in my opinion
16:22:29 <TheWhisper> Unless we're counting scrapers as LCD
16:22:41 <medos> no
16:22:55 <medos> (18:12:39) (@TheWhisper): Ha, that's funny. My browser URL field shortcut for searching Wolfram is wa too
16:22:55 <medos> (18:12:40) (Awesomius): medos: no results
16:22:55 <medos> (18:13:01) (@TheWhisper): Except mine works
16:23:02 <medos> that was all really
16:23:13 <TheWhisper> Lol
16:23:17 <medos> yours works because you are using plugins
16:23:27 <medos> bot aint got no noscript
16:23:36 <TheWhisper> Why don't you have the bot get the image link
16:23:37 <TheWhisper> http://www4b.wolframalpha.com/Calculate/MSP/MSP141971a3ace3hd6de9e6000002c1db40h83fbd9e9?MSPStoreType=image/gif&s=63&w=132&h=18
16:24:02 <medos> because it's probably using a deprecated api call and would work if it's updated
16:24:05 <TheWhisper> I'm not sure if that's uniquely keyed to my cookies though
16:24:31 <TheWhisper> http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/
16:24:56 <medos> so someone could sign up

23:11:15 <TheWhisper> Oh, hey, glad you're here. I have a question (that I've tried googling a bunch) and I can't figure it out.
23:11:26 <TheWhisper> It's about Bjango's tools 
23:11:42 <TheWhisper> "To install the Bjango Tools panel, copy the entire Bjango Tools folder to your Plug-ins/Panels/ folder and restart Photoshop."
23:11:50 <TheWhisper> I don't have the folder, so I tried adding it and dropping his thing in.
23:11:55 <TheWhisper> Still doesn't show up

23:17:34 <TheWhisper> ### Bjango Tools
23:17:34 <TheWhisper> A Photoshop panel that includes the most frequently used tools for interface and icon designers, spread out for quick access, plus buttons for turning pixel snapping on and off. Please note that you'll need to have Bjango Actions 1.4 installed for the buttons to work. To install the Bjango Tools panel, copy the entire Bjango Tools folder to your Plug-ins/Panels/ folder and restart Photoshop. The panel can be opened by choosing Window 
23:17:34 <TheWhisper> → Extensions → Bjango Tools.
23:17:40 <TheWhisper> Not his actions
23:17:42 <TheWhisper> The panel
