00:41:14 <TheWhisper> how can I activate fonts from two different groups?
00:41:16 <TheWhisper> select both?
00:42:02 <TheWhisper> or
00:42:06 <TheWhisper> make a set with the fonts I need, I guess?
00:43:43 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/pAVqO.gif
00:44:04 <TheWhisper> Is that the wrong way to do it?
00:44:15 <medos> no
00:44:18 <medos> it's the best way
00:44:23 <TheWhisper> ok
00:44:28 <medos> (serious on this one)
00:44:38 <medos> because you'd never really need more than a set
00:44:43 <medos> for one thing
00:44:46 <medos> project
00:44:54 <medos> or assignment
00:45:00 <TheWhisper> yeah
00:45:08 <medos> make some sets for font pairs
00:45:25 <medos> = each font stays in its folder + sets available
00:45:51 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/lI8WK.png
00:46:59 <medos> what's the dir structure of adobe font folio on your hd?
00:47:15 <medos> you can drag several folders into one NexusFolder at once
00:48:39 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/KoiN5.png
00:48:55 <TheWhisper> uh
00:49:00 <TheWhisper> It's not very organized
00:49:02 <TheWhisper> It's each font
00:49:04 <TheWhisper> in its own folder

01:47:01 <Kocho> yeah
01:47:05 <Kocho> its just the general concept
01:47:08 <Kocho> i just threw it on
01:47:12 <Kocho> like or dislike?
01:47:28 <Kocho> v1: http://ckgd.net/MISC/Screen%20Shot%202012-09-11%20at%204.20.53%20PM.png

01:47:42 <TheWhisper> I liked V2 better
01:47:46 <TheWhisper> V3 looks like
01:47:50 <TheWhisper> generic game icon 20403
01:47:54 <Kocho> i know
01:47:55 <Kocho> ugh
01:47:57 <Kocho> bloody hell
01:48:14 <Kocho> he lets me basically do what i want
01:48:22 <Kocho> but his last email is this
01:48:39 <Kocho> Maybe it is too trite, but so many of the icons in the app store just do the same things to great success. Tilting the logo slightly when it is simple (Peggle, SongPop, Super Hexagon). Adding the alternating color background (Angry Birds, Plants vs Zombies, Scribblenauts). 
01:48:54 <Kocho> maybe ill get rid of the tilt
01:49:32 <TheWhisper> hm
01:49:35 <TheWhisper> Tell him
01:49:40 <TheWhisper> that if he wants true success
01:49:46 <TheWhisper> He should design it himself ;)
01:49:54 <Kocho> that'll go down real well
01:51:10 <TheWhisper> medos http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5bj2wdIu91royiqyo1_400.jpg
01:51:12 <TheWhisper> Hm
01:51:21 <Kocho> thats nice
01:51:25 <TheWhisper> I dunno, can't think of any advice besides try to go more for v2 ;(
01:51:28 <Kocho> besides the buttons themselves
01:51:34 <TheWhisper> Kocho you like the shading on it?
01:51:35 <TheWhisper> ;)
01:51:37 <Kocho> yeah
01:51:40 <TheWhisper> lol

01:51:58 <Kocho> yeah
01:52:00 <TheWhisper> especially when you look at the bottom
01:52:02 <TheWhisper> and see
01:52:05 <Kocho> if you analyse it
01:52:06 <TheWhisper> that it's stacked

03:08:01 <TheWhisper> Like the icon, btw, kocho
03:08:59 <EDSGD1> Literally the worst tutoring experience today
03:09:42 <Kocho> what happened?
03:09:51 <EDSGD1> I'm not going to say anything but this ^
03:10:02 <EDSGD1> nah medos is going to get mad and upset
03:10:08 <medos> well
03:10:21 <medos> if you call your ladies you teach bitches you want to slap
03:10:28 <medos> that's not really tutoring aint it?
03:10:33 <Kocho> oh noes
03:10:46 <EDSGD1> I don't call them that in person
03:10:49 <medos> i mean doing it in here is semi-fine by me
03:10:59 <TheWhisper> YAY
03:11:01 <medos> doesn't change that your mindset fixates on lazy students being just that
03:11:02 <medos> lazy
03:11:03 <medos> ;)
03:11:10 <TheWhisper> i am
03:11:10 <TheWhisper> medos
03:11:11 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/9wOks.png
03:11:13 <TheWhisper> yay
03:11:58 <medos> neat ui design there
03:12:02 <EDSGD1> LE L ELE LE
03:12:09 <medos> how did ya make the title bar?
03:12:21 <TheWhisper> hm
03:12:24 <TheWhisper> still confused
03:12:51 <EDSGD1> anyway medos you seem like the person to ask. Have you used xpadder before?
03:14:29 <TheWhisper> what do I do
03:22:56 <TheWhisper> Wow
03:23:02 <TheWhisper> That was a lot easier than I assumed
03:23:05 <TheWhisper> I just made a macro in setpoint
03:23:07 <TheWhisper> i feel dumb now
03:34:33 <Kocho> good video medos
03:46:05 <Kocho> you know when you copy an art board with graphics on it
03:46:18 <Kocho> do your graphics shift sometimes?
03:47:28 <EDSGD1> option for mac alt for windows
03:48:05 <EDSGD1> nvm its the same key
03:48:06 <TheWhisper> hey guys
03:48:21 <TheWhisper> thoughts: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13494973/ShareX/2012-09/BeekeeperGuide_v2.pdf kocho edsgd1 medos thearrowflies etc
03:48:48 <TheWhisper> The layout is not that important
03:48:52 <TheWhisper> as the class is typography
03:48:59 <TheWhisper> So she said she only really cares about the typo
03:49:05 <thearrowflies> as someone who doesnt like reading unless there are pictures, it needs pictures
03:49:05 <EDSGD1> typography and layout 
03:49:18 <EDSGD1> *typography
03:49:45 <EDSGD1> I see baskerville
03:49:49 <EDSGD1> right?
03:50:01 <TheWhisper> yes
03:50:06 <TheWhisper> lol
03:50:09 <TheWhisper> tharrowflies
03:50:11 <TheWhisper> no pics
03:50:17 <Kocho> i don't like a few things
03:50:23 <TheWhisper> i don't like you
03:50:27 <TheWhisper> so tell me what the things are :D
03:50:36 <Kocho> page 1
03:50:46 <TheWhisper> oh
03:50:47 <TheWhisper> the cover?
03:50:49 <TheWhisper> that's not done yet
03:50:50 <Kocho> i hate the y in honeycombs
03:50:55 <EDSGD1> LOL you used the proper hyphen
03:50:56 <EDSGD1> :D
03:50:59 <Kocho> and the subtitle looks squashed
03:51:21 <Kocho> you sometimes use narrow and other times use regular in the bodycopy
03:51:25 <EDSGD1> Can I write on this TheWhisper?
03:51:26 <Kocho> its really annoying
03:51:30 <TheWhisper> do whatever you want
03:51:39 <EDSGD1> :D
03:51:41 <TheWhisper> kocho show me an example
03:51:54 <Kocho> page 2
03:51:57 <Kocho> (onwards)
03:52:09 <Kocho> "to Share - to copy, distribute..."
03:52:15 <Kocho> how share is narrow
03:52:30 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/WjMs6.png
03:52:31 <TheWhisper> like that
03:52:57 <TheWhisper> It's meant to separate the leaders from the descriptions
03:53:03 <TheWhisper> 'to share' is the topic
03:53:08 <TheWhisper> so it should be separated from the rest
03:53:09 <EDSGD1> before I start writing on this loose the justification. IMO I don't think it works that great with long copy
03:53:10 <TheWhisper> y'know?
03:53:23 <Kocho> http://i.imgur.com/Yp5k0.png
03:53:30 <Kocho> 'share' and 'remix'
03:53:42 <TheWhisper> Yeah I see
03:53:45 <Kocho> they are narrow
03:53:53 <EDSGD1> nvm I wont write on this. I'm just going to procrastinate even more
03:54:13 <Kocho> perhaps they should be 'normal' or italic
03:54:28 <Kocho> i don't think you really can integrate narrow into bodycopy
03:54:43 <Kocho> not for singular words like that anyway
03:55:27 <EDSGD1> Both your heading thing and your body copy look alike 
03:55:36 <EDSGD1> sorry for not using proper terms here
03:55:52 <EDSGD1> when I mean they look alike I mean the font size
03:56:05 <TheWhisper> idk what you're talking about ed
03:56:07 <TheWhisper> screenshot
03:56:14 <EDSGD1> fuck
03:56:19 <EDSGD1> K
03:56:23 <Kocho> you also have a n orphan 
03:56:27 <Kocho> an*
03:56:29 <EDSGD1> give me a sex
03:56:31 <EDSGD1> *sec
03:56:39 <Kocho> on page '1' (overview)
03:56:43 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/tsjxT.png
03:56:43 <EDSGD1> I also noticed a weird spacing issue
03:56:50 <TheWhisper> yeah, I just saw that
03:56:55 <Kocho> thats better
03:57:05 <Kocho> a,b,c shouldn't be narrow
03:57:07 <EDSGD1> seems like you did a hard return instead of a shift return
03:57:12 <Kocho> just get rid of all your narrow text
03:57:54 <Kocho> classification page - more vertical space between Hymenoptera and Kingdom
03:58:01 <Kocho> lose the narrow
03:58:01 <TheWhisper> edsgd1, what?
03:58:11 <EDSGD1> LOL wait 
03:58:19 <EDSGD1> I'm working on my stuff right now
03:59:01 <Kocho> also, page 4,5,6 (for example) have your paragraphs separated
03:59:15 <Kocho> they shouldn't just go to the next line
03:59:54 <Kocho> that is all for now
03:59:54 <Kocho> ;)
04:00:56 <TheWhisper> what do you mean
04:00:59 <TheWhisper> about having them separated?
04:01:32 <Kocho> why is my acrobat so stupid
04:02:09 <Kocho> http://i.imgur.com/RX1tE.png
04:02:27 <Kocho> you almost need a blank line between the two paragraphs
04:02:36 <Kocho> are you using baseline grid?
04:04:23 <TheWhisper> no
04:04:30 <TheWhisper> I don't like the baseline grid for things like this
04:06:42 <EDSGD1> TheWhisper
04:06:43 <EDSGD1> http://i.imgur.com/z1h0a.png
04:06:46 <EDSGD1> :p
04:07:11 <TheWhisper> hm
04:07:15 <TheWhisper> 1) it's not bold
04:07:27 <TheWhisper> Just condensed :P
04:07:38 <TheWhisper> but the italics should fix that
04:07:46 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/WVHow.png
04:07:55 <TheWhisper> I'll look at that spacing
04:07:55 <TheWhisper> and
04:08:07 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/TaXlC.png
04:08:15 <TheWhisper> I don't think it's any more important than the rest of the stuff on the page
04:10:10 <EDSGD1> :( Wish I could pick it a bit more, but I need to work on my stuff. Sorry for being a bit poor with the feedback
04:10:25 <TheWhisper> np
04:28:56 <marshmallow> dum de dum...
04:34:48 <TheWhisper> look at my thing
04:34:55 <TheWhisper> wow that sounded inappropriate
04:34:56 <TheWhisper> i mean
04:35:07 <TheWhisper> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/13494973/ShareX/2012-09/BeekeeperGuide_v2.pdf
04:46:50 <medos> why are you page numbers that huge?
04:51:44 <TheWhisper> because you weren't here
04:51:59 <Kocho> lol
04:52:36 <TheWhisper> going to sleep
04:52:42 <TheWhisper> gonna fix it a bit tomorrow morning
04:53:51 <Kocho> :(
05:02:46 <EDSGD1> so you can know which page number you
05:02:51 <EDSGD1> 're in duh
05:04:11 <EDSGD1> by the way, link is not working
05:04:16 <EDSGD1> IKB\
05:22:48 <marshmallow> que?  so plain
05:22:58 <marshmallow> off to bed.  I'll look at it some more tomorrow
05:44:41 <Kocho> medos?
05:48:30 <EDSGD1> What do you think about the font "Century Gothic"
05:49:03 <Kocho> its ok
05:49:13 <Kocho> so many better sans-serifs though
05:49:17 <EDSGD1> I agree
05:49:26 <Kocho> its quite overrated
05:50:18 <EDSGD1> I'm being forced to use it lol but it seems like it just tries to hard to look good
05:50:57 <Kocho> i hate how thin some of the letters are
05:51:04 <Kocho> like U and T are so thin
05:51:11 <Kocho> GC are really wide
05:51:38 <EDSGD1> Yeah and the kerning doesn't look great with heavy body copy
05:51:46 <Kocho> oh man
05:51:52 <Kocho> be worst using it in bodycopy
05:51:52 <EDSGD1> tracking seems fine doesn't bother me
05:51:58 <Kocho> it's ok with headings
05:52:02 <EDSGD1> Yeah
05:52:13 <Kocho> just feels like a poor mans Futura
05:52:19 <EDSGD1> lol
05:59:09 <EDSGD1> Damn Seriously hurting my eyes
06:08:24 <Kocho> whats this for EDSGD1?
06:11:05 <EDSGD1> On some magazine thing I'm working on 
06:12:13 <EDSGD1> Kocho wonderful Century Gothic http://i.imgur.com/1iJdA.png
06:12:24 <Kocho> mmm

06:17:52 <Kocho> i've done contracts before
06:18:00 <Kocho> but not design and photography together
06:18:00 <EDSGD1> purposely and tactful
06:18:09 <EDSGD1> Sound fun.
06:18:11 <Kocho> i think i will use century gothic
06:18:14 <Kocho> the client will spin out
06:18:19 <EDSGD1> HAHAHA
06:20:09 <EDSGD1> Oh man. 
06:20:42 <Kocho> damn, i forgot that with the contract i'm going to be paid by the guy printing it
06:20:42 <EDSGD1> When I have this class on Thursday. I'm gonna call them out and say, "You should feel bad" about choosing Century Gothic.
06:20:46 <Kocho> so it's like 3 parties ffs
06:21:02 <Kocho> hahah
06:21:08 <Kocho> you'll show 'em
06:21:08 <Kocho> ;)

17:45:18 <medos> yes
17:45:31 <medos> EDSGD what site were you on again?
17:45:34 <Azra-el> shutterstock has a good deal.. 750 images for 200E .. but it takes a month to get all of them
17:45:46 <medos> that combined getty, shutter, istock and several others.
17:47:24 <medos> http://photodune.net/
17:47:33 <medos> not the site

19:52:53 <EDSGD_> This mouse is horrible http://i.imgur.com/p2PYF.jpg
19:53:34 <EDSGD_> Pain in the butt using this to look at long documents in indesign
19:55:42 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/LkHjH.jpg
19:56:59 <EDSGD_> I'm using this which is worst http://imgur.com/OXD8P
19:57:03 <EDSGD_> IMO
19:58:00 <medos> should ask TheWhisper if he borrows you his old mouse
20:01:18 <EDSGD_> "if he borrows you his old mouse" will do
20:01:23 <EDSGD_> and his keyboard

20:56:44 <medos> anyone want a cubby invite?
20:56:54 <medos> it's like dropbox just a little more dynamic
20:57:01 <medos> and not as well working
20:57:07 <medos> but i'd get some moar space
20:57:10 <medos> :)
21:06:45 <medos> https://www.cubby.com/p/46a622fcdc5f413c8914fe6ba7b81581/Textures-Patterns
21:06:48 <medos> Looks like this.
21:07:02 <medos> (if you create a public link)
21:12:13 <EDSGD_> eewwwww
21:15:47 <EDSGD_> http://www.apple.com/iphone/
21:15:54 <EDSGD_> YAY just bought an iphone 5
21:15:55 <EDSGD_> :D
21:16:44 <medos> you did?
21:16:56 <medos> why? D:
21:17:06 <EDSGD_> because I'm stupid
21:18:06 <EDSGD_> and there's an apple store close to where I work
21:21:53 <medos> i'm fucking glad that my dev decided against landscape mode for iphone
21:22:28 <medos> would've been an entirely new asset set just because it has moar pixls
21:23:07 <EDSGD_> what if you're client requested it>
21:23:36 <medos> i'm not a client
21:24:47 <EDSGD_> LOL *your
21:30:56 <medos> not a client either
21:31:01 <medos> it's dev + designer
21:31:19 <medos> if he decides against it there's no one left to decide for it
21:31:30 <medos> except me
21:32:56 <EDSGD_> OK Now I understand. Is this Fridgepal>?
21:33:29 <medos> yeah
21:58:38 <CottonBalls_> I bought a midi keyboardddd.
21:58:43 <CottonBalls_> So excited.
21:59:53 <medos> so excited that he closed the browser

22:53:49 <TheWhisper> dafuq what?
22:55:49 <TheWhisper> hm
22:56:09 <TheWhisper> .showtells
22:56:25 <TheWhisper> Medos, the problem is that why would I want to carry a phone around
22:56:28 <TheWhisper> and an ipod
22:56:35 <TheWhisper> I don't listen to music while walking around
22:56:40 <TheWhisper> so the ipod would just be a device
22:56:42 <TheWhisper> for calendaring
22:56:49 <TheWhisper> and more often than not I'd probably forget it
22:56:55 <TheWhisper> My phone works well enough for now
22:57:02 <TheWhisper> and then when I get wp8, that'll hopefully work better
22:57:39 <medos> internet = reddit = bad for you
22:57:49 <medos> phone with internet = bad for you
22:57:50 <TheWhisper> lol
22:57:54 <TheWhisper> I don't go on reddit on my phone
22:58:02 <medos> ...yet
22:58:03 <TheWhisper> If anything, I'll read like one wired article on it a day
22:58:35 <TheWhisper> Did I show you tihs: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9b8-2QJKPo
22:58:37 <TheWhisper> *this
23:01:43 <TheWhisper> Ooh
23:02:54 <EDSGD_> Making me feel bad here
23:02:57 <EDSGD_> :(
23:03:05 <TheWhisper> why?
23:03:10 <EDSGD_> I used phone + everything you probably dislike
23:03:19 <EDSGD_> phone+music
23:03:25 <EDSGD_> Phone+internet
23:03:31 <EDSGD_> phone+ reddit
23:03:33 <TheWhisper> lol
23:26:21 <EDSGD_> dammnit 
23:26:50 <EDSGD_> instead of apple releasing a new phone they should have spent their time and money making a mouse that works
23:27:19 <medos> .gis apple ball mouse
23:27:50 <medos> http://images.macworld.com/images/legacy/2005/08/images/content/my3mice.jpg
23:27:58 <medos> ^ all of these are collectively horrible
23:28:06 <medos> center and right one i can vouch for
23:28:41 <TheWhisper> http://www.taskline.com/Default.asp
23:28:47 <EDSGD_> so annoying they are
23:28:55 <TheWhisper> Center one
23:28:57 <TheWhisper> is the worst mouse
23:28:58 <TheWhisper> in existence
23:29:04 <TheWhisper> I've used probably 30 of them in my life
23:29:12 <TheWhisper> and probably 20 of them have been unable to scroll down
23:29:14 <TheWhisper> because of dirt
23:29:18 <medos> hahaha
23:29:22 <medos> random sidescroll?
23:29:25 <medos> why not apple mouse
23:29:27 <TheWhisper> lol
23:29:34 <EDSGD_> I got those a lot with the magic mouse
23:29:35 <TheWhisper> Honestly, I thought it was a feature of the mouse
23:29:39 <TheWhisper> that they couldn't scroll down
23:29:46 <TheWhisper> simply because SO MANY of the ones I've used couldn't
23:29:52 <EDSGD_> they jump around way tooo much
23:29:55 <TheWhisper> I only recently found out it was just a shitty design
23:30:31 <EDSGD_> brb back to work
23:33:16 <TheWhisper> hm
23:33:26 <TheWhisper> Medos, any ideas on putting all my HW into outlook?
23:37:08 <medos> the cpu could turn out to be a problem
23:37:16 <medos> but ram and hard drive should fit in there
23:38:00 <TheWhisper> lol
23:38:56 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/M0q55.png
23:38:57 <TheWhisper> fuck yeah
23:38:59 <TheWhisper> that's what I wanted
23:41:08 <EDSGD_> windows8?
23:47:29 <TheWhisper> huh?
23:47:31 <TheWhisper> win 7
23:49:46 <TheWhisper> This software seems uber awesome
23:51:27 <medos> it has a rad timepiece so that's a given
23:51:46 <medos> + 'dem benjamins
23:51:55 <medos> how could it be bad

23:58:41 <Kocho> :(
23:58:44 <Kocho> poor fella
23:58:48 <medos> if i had the game i could tell you more
23:59:04 <medos> but he could just leave menus the same size and you'd have to add fitting backgrounds at most
23:59:16 <Kocho> it does seem that much different
23:59:22 <medos> nah
23:59:26 <Kocho> doesnt*
23:59:38 <medos> yup
