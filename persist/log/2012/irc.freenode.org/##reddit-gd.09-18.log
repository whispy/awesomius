02:48:12 <TheWhisper> what tv
02:48:41 <marshmallow> actually i lied
02:48:44 <marshmallow> t's not awesome
02:48:55 <marshmallow> it's a new show on NBC called Revolution
02:49:46 <marshmallow> plotline is one day the whole world loses all electricity.  batteries, cars, running water, etc. all dead
02:50:04 <marshmallow> flashfoward 10ish years into the future 
02:50:10 <marshmallow> and we have our current plotline
02:50:16 <TheWhisper> Yeah
02:50:18 <TheWhisper> I watched it
02:50:20 <TheWhisper> Lol
02:50:22 <TheWhisper> Like
02:50:24 <TheWhisper> 2 weeks ago
02:50:29 <TheWhisper> When it was released online
02:50:30 <TheWhisper> :)
02:50:31 <marshmallow> on hulu?
02:50:34 <marshmallow> oh, lol.
02:50:37 <marshmallow> i'm watching it now
02:50:46 <TheWhisper> OMG U R SO B-HIND
02:50:51 <TheWhisper> :p
02:50:58 <marshmallow> CAUSE I WATCHED IT ON REGULAR TV?!
02:51:00 <marshmallow> ZOMG!
02:51:01 <TheWhisper> I enjoyed it
02:51:05 <TheWhisper> But didn't think it was amazing
02:51:10 <TheWhisper> I'm gonna continue to watch it though
02:51:16 <marshmallow> yea, me too
02:51:22 <marshmallow> it's kinda stupid
02:51:24 <TheWhisper> Yeah
02:51:32 <Carson_> the trailer looks dumb, so i'm avoiding it, until I hear good things about it 
02:51:32 <marshmallow> like, if you want somebody captured ALIVE, don't fucking shoot
02:51:36 <TheWhisper> Lol
02:51:37 <marshmallow> like where's the logic in that?!
02:51:44 <TheWhisper> And the fact that the brother is in Chicago or w.e
02:51:49 <TheWhisper> But they get there in literally 2 minutes
02:52:03 <TheWhisper> oh
02:52:03 <marshmallow> i thought we were gonna have a long Lord of the Rings type of show
02:52:06 <TheWhisper> yeah
02:52:07 <marshmallow> ya know.. like endless walking
02:52:09 <TheWhisper> oh and then the brother
02:52:12 <TheWhisper> who is just like a normal soldier
02:52:18 <TheWhisper> kills at least 10 guys
02:52:20 <TheWhisper> who are fighting him
02:52:25 <marshmallow> WITh GUNS
02:52:26 <TheWhisper> and they have guns
02:52:28 <TheWhisper> and he has a sword
02:52:42 <marshmallow> stupid logic...  stop shooting the guy who you want alive!
02:52:44 <TheWhisper> I was just like 'are you serious? they have to be joking'
02:52:56 <marshmallow> yea
02:53:01 <TheWhisper> I wouldn't have been surprised if they showed him deflecting the bullets with his sword lol
02:53:09 <marshmallow> i'm also curious how they have those cool clothes
02:53:15 <marshmallow> leather?  how does she have that?
02:53:17 <TheWhisper> outsourcing
02:53:18 <TheWhisper> duh
02:53:20 <TheWhisper> lol
02:53:23 <marshmallow> lol
02:53:31 <marshmallow> makes total sense!
02:53:34 <TheWhisper> Just cuz there ain't no power don't mean there ain't no sweatshops
02:53:46 <TheWhisper> oh and then
02:53:54 <TheWhisper> the son just happens to go to the lady's house
02:54:01 <TheWhisper> and she just happens to be the lady
02:54:06 <TheWhisper> with another keychain flash drive

03:25:44 <TheWhisper> I think so

03:25:54 <TheWhisper> Like
03:25:56 <EDSGD> "I think so"
03:25:57 <TheWhisper> Did you watch Eureka?
03:26:14 <TheWhisper> It's along the same vein as Eureka
03:26:15 <EDSGD> Didn't like. Felt like I was watching filler episodes
03:26:20 <TheWhisper> as it's supposed to be like fun scifi
03:26:24 <EDSGD> I won't like it then.
03:26:26 <EDSGD> :p
03:26:28 <TheWhisper> though Warehouse 13 is more supernatural
03:26:29 <TheWhisper> than scifi
03:26:35 <TheWhisper> Give it a try though
03:26:37 <TheWhisper> You might ike it
03:26:42 <TheWhisper> *like

08:29:45 <Kocho> still suffering
08:29:49 <Kocho> its so shit
08:29:54 <Kocho> 'cause i dunno what I'm doing
08:29:58 <Kocho> lol
08:30:19 <medos> i don't like the fact that i'm supposed to enter my apple id to login to gamecenter through a beta app
08:30:20 <medos> D:
08:31:44 <medos> oh
08:31:53 <medos> i was actually logged out of gamecenter
08:33:22 <medos> logged in
08:33:23 <medos> works
08:33:30 <medos> kicks me out
08:34:27 <medos> reminds me of zakmac's beta

08:34:34 <medos> nothing happens
08:34:44 <medos> swoosh back to main screen
08:35:58 <Kocho> yeah
08:36:05 <zakmac> Hey now, you'd have updated demos if my phone wasn't stolen
08:36:07 <Kocho> i think it's still a wip
08:36:12 <zakmac> I'm sitting on a useless dev account 
08:36:59 <medos> neat
08:37:26 <medos> :(
08:37:48 <medos> https://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/approval/guidelines.html
08:37:54 <medos> zakmac can you access that site?
08:38:56 <medos> https://developer.apple.com/appstore/index.html
08:39:15 <medos> "Marketing Resources and Downloads" - on the left for "App Store"
08:39:17 <medos> i need those
08:39:28 <medos> nazbot has not yet supplied that shit
08:39:49 <zakmac> No :(
08:39:59 <medos> it should be some kind of iphone,ipod,ipad template, appstore badge
08:40:23 <zakmac> I have two accounts and can't remember my Dev info. I'll reset it tomorrow
08:40:43 <medos> Always use Apple-provided product images. Refer to page 10 for exceptions. Images can be downloaded at http://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/marketing. Both a vertical format and a horizontal format for each product are provided. The screen on the Apple product is blank so that you can display your app in the screen area
08:40:54 <zakmac> Oh I have that PDF if you want it
08:41:02 <medos> i have the pdf too
08:41:06 <zakmac> It's something like 120 pages of shit
08:41:08 <medos> but the link to the resources
08:41:19 <medos> i don't have a 120 page pdf :O
08:41:31 <medos> 16 pages
08:41:37 <medos> not sure if i need the monster one
08:41:44 <zakmac> Its 90% bullshit
08:41:57 <medos> then my 16 pages are the important part
08:42:40 <medos> because if i don't use those official iphone templates i'll have to get custom imagery approved by apple
08:45:17 <medos> that's twice as painful because i'd either have to make an iphone myself and get that approved
08:45:47 <medos> or find a template where the author gives full rights for usage and get that approved
08:45:49 <medos> :|
08:46:01 <zakmac> I also have that
08:46:02 <zakmac> Sec
08:46:44 <medos> i have like 5 iphone template psd's but no according TOS or CC info
08:46:51 <zakmac> These are from apple
08:46:54 <zakmac> This is*
08:47:18 <medos> hooray
08:48:21 <medos> will you still be awake in 15 minutes?
08:48:28 <medos> i'm about to reposition my laptop
08:48:41 <medos> i'll just wait till you link the glorious apple approved template

15:19:17 <medos> minus removed the download all button
15:19:18 <medos> :(
15:20:55 <medos> i also just got a dropbox email suggesting that i should upgrade to pro
15:21:25 <medos> after sharing an image on reddit yesterday and moving a lot of shit to my dropbox folder last week
15:21:27 <medos> D:
15:22:54 <Sat> what capacity do you have?
15:24:13 <medos> i have the basic free 2gb dropbox but i've used a lot of promo-events and invite stuff to get to 12.4 gb
15:25:02 <Sat> i'm happy with my 3.75gb at the moment ^^
15:26:08 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/bCnVd.png
15:27:43 <medos> i would not survive with 3.75 :P
15:28:15 <Sat> less space more managment
15:31:21 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/plgZ6.png >:(
15:31:39 <medos> more space equal managementt
15:32:16 <Sat> i meant take stuff down if your not using it
15:32:55 <medos> yup, stuff i don't use is on cubby/google drive/sugarsync
15:35:52 <medos> less work if i need old files or a client needs old file X
15:36:07 <medos> locate cloud account it's stored on and link dat shit
15:41:09 <marshmallow> wow
15:41:14 <marshmallow> i just have 2gb i think
15:41:31 <marshmallow> I mostly use dropbox for my cell's photos
15:42:44 <medos> i like to directly work inside of dropbox folders
15:42:51 <medos> because i can recover earlier revisions
15:43:04 <medos> every time i save a file in photoshop/illustrator
15:43:15 <medos> dropbox saves a revision

18:36:42 <medos> that's not a problem that's how chrome works

18:38:14 <medos> you need to fix
18:38:17 <medos> your cleartype settings
18:41:02 <medos> or
18:41:14 <medos> activate gpu acceleration chrome://flags/
18:42:36 <medos> or something
18:42:40 <medos> there's a shitload of settings
18:42:55 <medos> i tend to keep it ugly to know if chrome fixes it and see where websites fuck up
18:44:27 <TheWhisper> Plus he wants to keep it looking like him

18:45:01 <marshmallow_> ^^ Evolution spoilers
18:45:45 <Sat> tried cleartype and didnt fix it, gpu acceleration doesnt say it will improve how fonts are rendered, ugly it stays!
18:47:02 <TheWhisper> sat
18:47:04 <TheWhisper> google
18:47:06 <TheWhisper> uh

18:48:41 <vadoo>  hey all
18:49:09 <medos> Sat which page is the worst for this?
18:49:30 <vadoo> no big news medos, I'm still reorganizing some components and I'm implementing an upload feature
18:49:38 <medos> hooray
18:49:50 <medos> hurry up, cssdeck.com features realtime collab coding now
18:49:54 <medos> :P
18:49:59 <vadoo> this is the latest stable build: http://vassilis.proof10.nodejitsu.com/ePNm3fDEa
18:50:23 <vadoo> I've added a click animation from the last time you saw it
18:50:45 <medos> awesome
18:50:52 <Sat> that confused me a bit thewhisper, i think ill just stick to using firefox when i want to see a page properly :D
18:51:06 <TheWhisper> firefox has the same problem as chrome
18:51:16 <TheWhisper> unless you turn on directwrite and gpu accel
18:51:26 <Sat> renders fine for me
18:51:39 <medos> waiting for a fix is better than fucking with windows font rendering settings that might fuck up stuff in other places
18:52:58 <vadoo> you might also want to check if you have the latest drivers for your graphics card
18:53:14 <medos> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/04/24/a-closer-look-at-font-rendering/
18:53:40 <medos> gpu acceleration changes the way fonts render
18:54:12 <medos> because gpu acceleration falls under AntiAliasing settings you have in your gpu driver settings
18:55:18 <Sat> https://www.dropbox.com/s/ssi7d5woafh9hlo/text-apperance.jpg
