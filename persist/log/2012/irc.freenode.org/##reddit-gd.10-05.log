00:20:50 <Kocho> yeah thats true

00:39:38 <medos> back then
00:41:00 <Kocho> man im so stupid
00:41:22 <Kocho> finally worked out that i should just search for 'wall heater' and then just replace the existing heater

00:46:54 <medos> Kocho yup should be easy with a few patterns and eyedropper'd gradient overlay for depth
00:47:03 <Kocho> yep yep
00:47:07 <medos> *one pattern
00:47:25 <Kocho> it's a bit small though
00:47:31 <Kocho> got anything larger
00:47:33 <Kocho> kidding ;)
00:48:57 <medos> lol
00:49:01 <Kocho> here all day people
00:49:35 <TheWhisper> Medos, a wirstchaftgymnasium
00:49:39 <TheWhisper> = vocational school?
00:50:03 <medos> yeah
00:50:15 <medos> i haven't really added anything beyond that
00:50:22 <medos> my former employer is not on linked in
00:50:24 <TheWhisper> interesting
00:50:25 <TheWhisper> Lol
00:50:31 <TheWhisper> You can still add their info though
00:50:35 <medos> wirtschaftsgymnasium = school for business
00:50:35 <TheWhisper> So people know that you worked there
00:50:46 <medos> yeah i will complete that thing someday
00:51:43 <Kocho> grr, the perspective aint gonna work
00:52:07 <TheWhisper> Ahhahaha. Medos, you linked: http://illyism.com/ earlier. 
00:52:17 <TheWhisper> If you view it with NoScript on, their name is in Comic Sans
00:52:53 <TheWhisper> I remember seeing http://dribbble.com/shots/495016-Party-Animal on reddit
00:53:24 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/nawkS.png
00:53:47 <TheWhisper> lol
00:54:32 <TheWhisper> Oh cool, dropbox beta. Let's just make my desktop and taskbar invisible.
00:54:40 <TheWhisper> Oh, nevermind
00:54:48 <TheWhisper> Just needed to restart explorer, I guess
00:55:43 <TheWhisper> Whoa, this looks really nice. I had no idea you could do something like that on Windows!
00:55:52 <medos> http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques/comments/rm89v/i_suck_at_this_logo_for_a_personal_project/
00:56:07 <TheWhisper> Medos, do you know of any other programs that have menus like this on windows?
00:56:14 <medos> menus like what?
00:57:35 <TheWhisper> Like the new dropbox
00:57:37 <TheWhisper> beta
01:01:27 <medos> .g windows software with custom notification overlay
01:02:24 <medos> i presume
01:02:28 <medos> there will be a lot of tools
01:02:32 <medos> who do that in the future
01:02:51 <medos> because there are designers out there who conceptualize and create them
01:02:53 <medos> aplenty
01:03:09 <medos> fuck
01:03:10 <medos> you
01:03:13 <medos> illustrator
01:03:19 <TheWhisper> If the feature was available, I'm surprised no one has taken advantage of it yet
01:03:22 <medos> and memory leaking opengl bugging
01:03:42 <medos> your memory is pretty short eh
01:05:15 <TheWhisper> Other programs have?
01:05:37 <medos> sure
01:05:39 <medos> plenty of them
01:07:05 <TheWhisper> Google is just giving me how to add icons to the systray itself when I search :(
01:08:55 <medos> :(
01:09:00 <medos> too bad
01:09:01 <medos> mang
01:09:56 <medos> as a designer i can tell you it does not float everyones boat when an icon in the notification area behaves differently
01:10:09 <medos> as a user i can tell you the minus desktop tool did this too
01:10:23 <medos> as a user i can tell you their popup annoyed the hell out of me
01:10:40 <TheWhisper> Yeah
01:10:43 <medos> as a user i can tell you their popup does not exist anymore because the whole desktop tool got scrapped
01:10:46 <medos> like
01:10:48 <medos> abandoned
01:10:53 <medos> does not exist anymore
01:10:54 <TheWhisper> I don't think it's a great usability thing
01:11:00 <TheWhisper> Just a cool thing that I've never seen before on Win
01:13:34 <Kocho> doing the app design has made me a better designer imo
01:13:47 <TheWhisper> What does it look like now?
01:13:49 <Kocho> i can now draw heaters
01:14:00 <medos> hawt
01:14:22 <medos> Kocho same for me, working efficiently on a huge image
01:14:25 <medos> is easypeasy now
01:14:43 <Kocho> =D
01:14:47 <medos> before it was "hnnnngh imma put this here and that there and add some random shading till it fits"
01:15:14 <medos> now the whole thing is happening without any real effort
01:15:55 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-05%20at%2011.15.07%20AM.png
01:16:07 <TheWhisper> Wait, this is for attention: pay it?
01:16:10 <Kocho> no
01:16:16 <Kocho> (photo is the left image)
01:16:19 <TheWhisper> Oh
01:16:57 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/YDPzT.png Having those lines continue over the black makes it seem 2-dimensional
01:17:00 <TheWhisper> Looking cool though
01:17:12 <Kocho> yeah that was me being lazy
01:17:15 <Kocho> i'll fix that
01:17:17 <TheWhisper> Now just add 500 almost invisible gradients and you'll be at medos level
01:17:24 <Kocho> thats true
01:17:27 <Kocho> not there yet :(
01:17:36 <TheWhisper> lol
01:18:47 <medos> not tru
01:22:14 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/ND3si.png <- crazy mofo
01:22:32 <TheWhisper> What's that?
01:22:43 <TheWhisper> Oh Kocho's
01:23:03 <TheWhisper> Darl
01:27:39 <medos> .g faststone image viewer 4.6
01:27:49 <medos> ^ TheWhisper give this a shot
01:27:56 <TheWhisper> for what
01:28:21 <TheWhisper> As an alternative to irfan?
01:29:40 <medos> as an addition to your tool library
01:29:44 <medos> it has a neat compare feature
01:29:46 <medos> and more
01:30:59 <TheWhisper> I'll check it out
01:31:09 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/HDN6K.jpg
01:31:38 <TheWhisper> Not bad
01:31:42 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/r9laK.jpg
01:31:53 <TheWhisper> I wish there was a program that allowed borderless comparisons though
01:31:57 <TheWhisper> *were
01:32:15 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/z6fIg.jpg
01:33:52 <medos> those menus pop up when you move your mouse to the side of the screen
01:33:55 <medos> up down left right
01:34:00 <medos> each area has an overlay
01:34:09 <medos> left = tools like sharpen or resize or export
01:34:14 <medos> right = exif
01:34:27 <medos> bottom = filemanager and navigator
01:34:32 <medos> top = the bar you saw
01:35:04 <TheWhisper> nice
01:35:43 <medos> compare view has a button
01:35:50 <medos> so you can overlay one file over the other one
01:35:54 <medos> for duration of pressing
01:36:01 <medos> which is a lot better than borderless
01:37:12 <TheWhisper> that's sick
01:38:07 <medos> fullscreen mousewheel = go through images
01:38:16 <medos> hold down left mouse button and move = zoom in
01:38:22 <medos> for duration of holding mouse button
01:40:34 <TheWhisper> dammit indesign do not crash :(
01:40:39 <TheWhisper> yay
01:41:37 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/U0HAX.png

01:49:02 <Matt3000> How is it?
01:49:11 <Matt3000> Not much, just doing some homework
01:51:30 <medos> it's a bit like buying a new pc
01:51:37 <medos> it's a little bit better in every corner
01:51:45 <medos> not really thaaaaat huge of an impact
01:52:06 <medos> till you realize that you do shitloads of stuff that wouldn't have been possible with your old machine
01:52:20 <Matt3000> Like what?
01:52:37 <Matt3000> Im still not convinced. I think I might wait until a few upgrades
01:52:50 <medos> not a salesman for adobe
01:52:54 <medos> i like it
01:52:55 <medos> ;)
01:53:02 <Matt3000> haha
01:53:06 <Matt3000> good!
01:53:10 <Matt3000> That's what matters.
01:58:37 <TheWhisper> medos, what's that storyboard for?
01:59:19 <medos> for a video?
02:00:00 <TheWhisper> Oh, I thought it was for your life
02:00:32 <medos> it kinda is
02:00:40 <medos> don't wanna spend my life on the streets
02:00:44 <medos> so i'm doing it
02:00:46 <TheWhisper> Lol
02:07:32 <medos> which makes me realize

02:10:07 <medos> eyestrain? evenly lit?
02:10:51 <Matt3000> its great. I use flux though so I dont strain too bad, but its incredible. 
02:11:09 <Matt3000> The only bad thing is I still cant match the colors with my other Acer.
02:11:19 <Matt3000> So my older one has a different color than it
02:12:18 <medos> imagine having that problem on one screen where the light is so uneven that the same color fades depending on where it is
02:12:26 <medos> that's what I'm going through ;)
02:12:34 <Matt3000> oh god
02:12:37 <medos> you should probably activate color profiles
02:12:38 <Matt3000> what kind of monitor is it?
02:12:43 <medos> it's a thinkpad
02:12:46 <Matt3000> I dont know how
02:13:22 <Matt3000> if you mean on the moniotor themselves, they are different
02:13:46 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/zWRp9.png
02:14:14 <medos> Looking closely at the individual values, there is a nasty surprise: While the maximum value is 252 cd/m² , at its darkest, it is 170 cd/m². That is a difference in brightness of 82 cd/m²! The values are spread so that, one can see the brightness curve of the left side even with the naked eye.
02:14:19 <medos> ;)
02:14:53 <Matt3000> oh wow
02:15:14 <medos> if you work fullscreen on a document
02:15:23 <Matt3000> is that on thinkpads?
02:15:30 <medos> cheap ones ;(

03:01:40 <medos> remove shadow bevel on left side of heater
03:02:03 <medos> french flag aint fitting at all make it more subtle and place it differently?
03:03:05 <medos> heater should throw a sliiiight shadow somehow
03:03:32 <medos> and it looks like it sticks out of the wall like /
03:03:38 <TheWhisper> Where's the light from, kocho
03:03:55 <Kocho> above
03:03:57 <Kocho> probably
03:04:04 <Kocho> bah heater is screwed then
03:04:04 <Kocho> lol
03:04:15 <TheWhisper> lol
03:04:16 <Kocho> ok minus the heater effects
03:04:20 <Kocho> thoughts?
03:04:27 <Kocho> eg: the french flag etc
03:04:27 <TheWhisper> Give it a little more weight too
03:04:30 <TheWhisper> It doesn't have volume
03:04:37 <Kocho> the heater?
03:04:43 <TheWhisper> yeah
03:04:49 <medos> mind showing a 1:1 shot not a lowres indd preview?
03:04:51 <TheWhisper> Yeah
03:04:53 <TheWhisper> ^ please
03:04:59 <Kocho> ok
03:05:54 <medos> if their logo is colored like that i would recommend putting a colorpicked overlay of tha color on the couch
03:06:19 <medos> sofa looks like warm light, logo & heater like cold white light
03:06:50 <medos> *couch
03:06:57 <medos> cushion seating device
03:06:58 <medos> whichever
03:07:00 <Kocho> lol
03:07:14 <Kocho> yeah, i tried putting a photo filter over the top of it all (not the logo)
03:07:19 <Kocho> but it didn't really work
03:07:21 <medos> nono
03:07:23 <medos> just the couch
03:07:34 <Kocho> a cold filter over the couch?
03:07:35 <medos> and at verrry low saturation
03:07:38 <medos> or just
03:07:39 <medos> yeah
03:07:42 <Kocho> oh yep
03:07:44 <Kocho> gotchya
03:07:54 <medos> nooooo not photo filter
03:07:55 <medos> btw
03:08:08 <medos> colorpick their logo
03:08:11 <medos> mask the couch
03:08:17 <TheWhisper> Before all that though
03:08:20 <TheWhisper> show 1:1
03:08:24 <Kocho> im uploading
03:08:35 <Kocho> 1:1 will be too big
03:08:46 <Kocho> but I'm doing a better res version
03:09:02 <medos> just the non-low-res-preview window would be better
03:09:19 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/LevanteSticker.jpg
03:09:34 <Kocho> excuse the way the heater panels look, they are even
03:11:36 <TheWhisper> 1:1 will be too bif your your face
03:11:38 <TheWhisper> wow
03:11:48 <TheWhisper> Let's just forget I even attempted to write something there.
03:12:07 <TheWhisper> See if you can't make the lighting on the logo, heater, and couch all match.
03:12:32 <TheWhisper> Hm
03:12:36 <TheWhisper> Flag is too colorful
03:12:42 <TheWhisper> Make it gray and white ;)
03:12:45 <Kocho> ask france to change it
03:12:46 <Kocho> lol
03:12:47 <TheWhisper> Petition the french government to change it
03:12:47 <TheWhisper> lol
03:12:48 <TheWhisper> yeah
03:12:59 <Kocho> the logo has a white background
03:13:00 <TheWhisper> But see if you can't introduce another colorful element to balance it somewhere maybe
03:13:08 <Kocho> so thats why i went with the gradient fade
03:13:14 <TheWhisper> Ah
03:13:19 <TheWhisper> Yeah, that fade is weird
03:13:20 <TheWhisper> Just noticed it
03:13:26 <TheWhisper> It doesn't match the BG
03:13:36 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/goqME.png
03:14:06 <TheWhisper> Also

03:14:37 <TheWhisper> See if maybe you can't move the heater left
03:14:44 <TheWhisper> and then make the couch a little bigger or soemthing
03:14:56 <Kocho> I'm not sure if the heater is too big
03:15:05 <Kocho> i don't have a real life image of it which shows it's size
03:15:12 <TheWhisper> lol
03:15:14 <TheWhisper> hahaha

03:18:46 <medos> the cushions just suck
03:18:56 <medos> but with some slight adjustments it looks better
03:18:57 <medos> imo
03:19:17 <TheWhisper> Oh, thank him

03:19:20 <TheWhisper> lol

03:20:01 <TheWhisper> Kocho what's the exact product name?
03:20:07 <Kocho> no idea
03:20:11 <TheWhisper> lol
03:20:14 <TheWhisper> http://www.cef.co.uk/catalogue/brands/304-levante?summary=1 might be here
03:20:29 <TheWhisper> though
03:20:36 <TheWhisper> that probs wouldn't give youm uch info
03:20:38 <medos> sounds like me the first few weeks working at the newspaper
03:20:47 <Kocho> thats not the right brand i don't think
03:20:55 <medos> gathers info for an hour
03:21:03 <medos> gets slap on head by boss
03:21:11 <TheWhisper> me?
03:21:21 <medos> the research part
03:21:37 <TheWhisper> I usually don't do enough research
03:23:48 <medos> Kocho last thing: you might try to give the 10 year warranty thing a bit more contrast
03:24:19 <Kocho> kk
03:24:28 <medos> the gradient you have on it suggests either a different light source
03:24:51 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/GUSZU.png
03:24:56 <medos> or you tried to bevel it?
03:25:09 <medos> makes it look cheap while it doesn't have to
03:25:11 <Kocho> th 10?
03:25:15 <Kocho> the*
03:25:23 <Kocho> or the gradient behind?
03:25:29 <medos> gradient behind
03:26:01 <medos> left: precise heavy metally 3d logo
03:26:09 <medos> right: subtle attempt at depth
03:26:24 <medos> i'd try not giving it depth at all
03:26:42 <medos> bleh

03:50:24 <Kocho> :)
03:50:52 <medos> Kocho designers love subtle differences
03:51:10 <medos> customers think subtle differences are hard to read gibberish
03:51:18 <medos> or consumers rather
03:51:20 <TheWhisper> ^ lol
03:51:23 <TheWhisper> true
03:51:38 <TheWhisper> Medos, what does your purse actually look like. I wanna see sketches :P

05:01:05 <IAmLegend> i don't know how to stop
05:01:32 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> i suck at snowboarding.  I would never do that jump.  I'ld be too afraid of breaking my very needed legs
05:01:46 <TheWhisper> I love skiing
05:01:52 <TheWhisper> Iamlegend it's just like ice skating
05:01:56 <TheWhisper> in terms of stopping
05:01:58 <IAmLegend> its not
05:02:01 <IAmLegend> no
05:02:02 <IAmLegend> wrong
05:02:02 <TheWhisper> yer it is
05:02:03 <TheWhisper> or biking
05:02:12 <IAmLegend> bikes you have brakes
05:02:16 <TheWhisper> just press in the brakes on your legs
05:02:18 <IAmLegend> skiing you have no brakes
05:02:19 <TheWhisper> and there ya go
05:02:24 <TheWhisper> YOU ARE THE BRAKE
05:02:34 <IAmLegend> ice skating you're on a flat surface with walls
05:02:44 <IAmLegend> skiing you have downhill, trees and no brakes
05:02:49 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> ice skating and skiing aren't really that similar
05:02:52 <IAmLegend> i fell on purpose to stop
05:03:09 <TheWhisper> fail
05:03:10 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> I've haven't fallen in like a decade with ice skating...  I will fall in a heart beat if i ski

05:05:58 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFEJO2ezl8c&list=FLalB93tMPSk2pvGl2L8ZC8w&index=29&feature=plpp_video iamlegend
05:06:01 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> *go buys designer
05:06:25 <TheWhisper> *get paycheck
05:06:32 <TheWhisper> *go buy everything
05:06:33 <TheWhisper> :P
05:06:33 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> none of my friends lives paycheck to paycheck though.  we're good enough to know how to handle our money
05:06:40 <medos> yeah
05:06:40 <IAmLegend> i prefer wasting my money on other things
05:06:56 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> quite honestly, I forget when my paycheck comes.  I have direct deposit.  I don't notice 90% of the time.
05:06:57 <IAmLegend> nah, i save most of my money
05:07:15 <IAmLegend> paypal feels like fake money though
05:07:37 <medos> the storyboard starts out with getting a paycheck right now
05:07:47 <medos> i might have to complain about that
05:08:10 <medos> i wasn't sure, it felt off to connect designer clothing with getting paid
05:08:11 <medos> mh
05:08:16 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> i mean, I know some of my coworkers who gets paycheck and then goes shopping
05:08:32 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> there are plenty of girls who probably do that
05:08:35 <pandaaaaaaaaaa> i'm just not one of them
05:08:41 <IAmLegend> im not a girl
05:08:52 <medos> girls who do that wouldn't really watch out for deals either though
05:08:55 <medos> like
05:09:02 <medos> get paid go shopping
05:09:07 <medos> be broke
05:09:09 <IAmLegend> a lot of girls / women just like shopping
05:09:21 <IAmLegend> i don't even like going to the shops
05:09:34 <TheWhisper> iamlegend, that song

06:53:55 <medos> no he uses youtube's nsfw warning
06:55:05 <medos> .y shabushabu - honyanko bushi
06:56:28 <EDSGD> I love it. How'd you know I like this?
06:56:42 <medos> did you know it?
06:57:03 <EDSGD> No. I just <3 it.
06:58:00 <EDSGD> medos http://i.imgur.com/VTVDp.png
06:58:13 <medos> I know that you like absurd, seemingly random stuff that involves abstractions of people/persons
06:58:39 <medos> stuff that is well done and precisely crafted to look random and weird to most people :P
07:00:24 <medos> are you working on that ?
07:00:41 <EDSGD> Yeah.
07:00:42 <medos> i remember the snapshots on your site looking different
07:00:53 <EDSGD> Still needs tweaking.
07:01:04 <EDSGD> Yeah, they looked worst than this :p
07:01:10 <EDSGD> *worse
07:02:46 <medos> fire up dropbox
07:04:21 <EDSGD> AWW MAN. I did bad.
07:04:24 <EDSGD> :(
07:05:01 <medos> no
07:05:09 <EDSGD> :)
07:05:11 <medos> you did pretty fucking well
07:05:17 <medos> just the sizing of items is a little off
07:05:19 <EDSGD> YAY! :D
07:05:24 <EDSGD> Yeah 
07:05:25 <EDSGD> hah
07:05:27 <EDSGD> a
07:05:42 <EDSGD> BTW have you seen this GEM? http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=yOxJwV9yMiU
07:06:57 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/jZnWY.gif
07:09:17 <EDSGD> LOL
07:14:36 <EDSGD> medos http://i.imgur.com/gqGL1.jpg
07:15:22 <medos> that's a jpg :(
07:15:29 <EDSGD> Yes.
07:15:40 <EDSGD> Were you expecting a PNG?
07:15:53 <medos> i bet the turquoise is more pronounced uncompressed
07:16:05 <medos> because right now the "vision" looks blurry and muddy
07:16:17 <EDSGD> true.
07:16:21 <medos> probably imgur compressions fault
07:16:26 <medos> (partially :P)
07:16:43 <EDSGD> how did I get a png? before
07:16:58 <medos> imgur converts stuff that would be too biggie as png
07:17:00 <medos> to jpg
07:17:10 <medos> so photos = over 1mb = turn into jpg
07:17:12 <medos> ruin pic
07:18:12 <EDSGD> OOOHHHHHH
07:18:15 <EDSGD> Good to know. 
07:18:18 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/QlFtW.gif
07:18:32 <EDSGD> Here's also this one. I need to work a bit more on the type. http://i.imgur.com/z0c2S.jpg
07:18:53 <medos> yup
07:19:03 <EDSGD> The transition could've been done a bit better.
07:20:00 <medos> btw.: how much do you hate the candy & happy glossy design style?
07:20:56 <medos> just asking because i always see you adding some gritty elements :)
07:21:48 <medos> -always +in places where i wouldn't expect them :P
07:21:55 <EDSGD> example.
07:22:17 <EDSGD> Haven't difficulty trying to figure out what you're trying to say.
07:22:41 <medos> you add a lot of ffffound style images to your stuff http://28.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lfe3uhFMi51qzezj5o1_500.jpg
07:23:16 <medos> which is not a bad thing but makes it harder to judge the actual product/details
07:23:59 <EDSGD> Wow. I never noticed.
07:24:03 <EDSGD> You're right.
07:24:32 <EDSGD> And I don't dislike the happy candy stuff.
07:24:40 <medos> as i said it's not a bad thing but i can't judge details on an interface with world war II propagande esque intense detailed black and white pic eating most space :)
07:25:56 <EDSGD> OK I'll change to more happy stuff just in this case.
07:26:06 <medos> doesn't even have to be happy stuff
07:26:06 <EDSGD> Also Here's my annual report thing
07:26:20 <EDSGD> still playing around.
07:26:58 <EDSGD> http://i.imgur.com/NhujV.png
07:27:15 <medos> awwww yea
07:27:33 <medos> that's more like it

07:32:15 <medos> i wouldn't really know how i would group that style
07:32:35 <EDSGD> :(
07:32:46 <EDSGD> Need to hit back the list of fonts.
07:33:02 <medos> if you use slab for headings
07:33:06 <medos> and the logo is slab
07:33:06 <EDSGD> A bit difficult trying to find the right combinations.
07:33:17 <medos> you're taking away from the visual appeal and impact of the logo
07:33:21 <EDSGD> yes.
07:33:22 <medos> personal opinion here
07:33:25 <medos> i have no proof for that
07:33:38 <EDSGD> hmmm
07:34:36 <medos> apple gets away with excessive myriad use
07:34:54 <EDSGD> Oh I can go with Helvetica + Helvetica 
07:34:59 <EDSGD> makes people moist.
07:35:05 <medos> lol
07:35:05 <EDSGD> :p
07:35:39 <medos> pick something that has lots of weights
07:35:47 <EDSGD> Helvetica Neue
07:35:53 <medos> and is not used constantly
07:36:00 <EDSGD> :p

07:36:17 <medos> no recommendations

07:38:41 <EDSGD> night. Off to bed.
07:39:18 <medos> hey
07:39:30 <medos> next time
07:39:44 <medos> you make some connected mockups and share them via dropbox
07:39:54 <EDSGD> will do.
07:39:54 <medos> harder to judge the thing seeing jpg after jpg :)
07:40:02 <EDSGD> night.

17:11:29 <Carson> anyone have recommendations for portable music players?
17:11:43 <adding_confusion> like ipods?
17:14:13 <Carson> yeah or another brand
17:14:44 <Carson> some people are turned off by ipods because the bad sound quality
17:14:54 <Carson> because of*
17:15:33 <Carson> I like those older gen. ipod nanos that are square and touch screen 
17:15:56 <Carson> but it's a bit small for my fingers 
17:17:07 <adding_confusion> i dont know where the technology for music devices has gone
17:17:26 <adding_confusion> im all iphone'en it
17:18:33 <Carson> yeah :/
17:19:09 <pandaaaaaaaaaaaa> sorry, that is the one area I conceed to Apple
17:19:11 <Carson> all in one devices are dominating, even though the technology is far superior in the single purpose tech
17:19:18 <pandaaaaaaaaaaaa> Apple is pretty good for mp3's
17:19:26 <Carson> I'm on a macbook air, and a imac right now :_
17:19:28 <Carson> :)
17:19:31 <pandaaaaaaaaaaaa> and i'm a huge apple hater
17:19:40 <pandaaaaaaaaaaaa> but i'll give them the "win" for mp3 players
17:20:00 <pandaaaaaaaaaaaa> though, I never use mine.  I mostly use my phone with an app or  computer
17:20:38 <pandaaaaaaaaaaaa> as long as I'm in an area with service, my phone has an amazing battery life and I can use it as a mp3 player easily
17:20:48 <Carson> I thought mp3 had bad quality
17:21:23 <adding_confusion> get a .flac player that would be cool.. do they make those?
17:22:39 <Carson> yeah 
17:22:55 <Carson> i feel like i can't trust the UI though
17:22:59 <adding_confusion> portable player i mean
17:23:18 <Carson> apple always has good UI in their OS's

20:09:38 <adding_confusion> normally with mtn bike advice people say to go with Giant because they own the manufacturing plants that other bike companies have to lease from them. they can usually get you a cheaper bike with better components
