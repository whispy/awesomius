01:28:25 <edodes> Is tehre a technique similar to this in illustrator? or is it just better to use photoshop? http://youtu.be/iHNO4Sgnw5E
01:28:30 <edodes> there*
01:29:10 <edodes> The image I would be wrapping it around is basically a technical drawing. So no color, just black outline...

04:31:24 <edodes> I've been paid
04:31:25 <marshmallow> but i'm putting a care package together =D
04:31:29 <edodes> and I never have to speak to that woman again
04:31:31 <marshmallow> yay!
04:31:33 <edodes> for who?
04:31:34 <marshmallow> gj!
04:31:45 <edodes> heh thanks

04:32:02 <marshmallow> 5
04:32:06 <edodes> aww
04:32:14 <edodes> that'll be cool for him
04:32:22 <edodes> does he know you're sending it?
04:32:27 <marshmallow> doubt it
04:32:30 <edodes> :D
04:32:34 <edodes> surprises are the best
04:32:40 <marshmallow> the guy is 4
04:32:45 <marshmallow> i didn't know anything when i was 4
04:32:50 <edodes> lol
04:33:10 <marshmallow> but yea... small toys and some essentials
04:33:19 <marshmallow> as much as i can fit into this box without it going too heavy
04:33:40 <edodes> that'll be cool :)
04:34:17 <marshmallow> yea
04:34:25 <marshmallow> this mini football doesn't wanna fit
04:34:26 <marshmallow> grrrr
04:34:29 <edodes> xD
04:34:35 <edodes> deflate + add pump
04:35:34 <marshmallow> oh, it's a small one
04:35:53 <marshmallow> like... 6x4inches
04:36:01 <marshmallow> and foam-ish
04:36:07 <marshmallow> so, no hole
04:36:17 <edodes> bummer
04:36:24 <edodes> ziploc + vacuum
04:36:28 <edodes> :D
04:36:34 <edodes> genius!
04:36:38 <edodes> I know, you can say it
04:36:49 <marshmallow> lol
04:37:44 <edodes> It'd probably work too
04:37:53 <edodes> you've got to try it now
04:38:12 <edodes> put everything in a vacuum seal bag, that'd be awesome
04:38:21 <edodes> *POOF* when opened
04:38:58 <marshmallow> nah
04:39:02 <marshmallow> this is like plastic toys
04:39:11 <edodes> crunch :(
04:39:19 <marshmallow> vacuum sealing a mcdonald power ranger toy isn't gonna save any space
04:39:24 <edodes> xD
04:40:07 <marshmallow> =D
04:40:56 <marshmallow> i hope the power rangers toy is okay to send
04:41:00 <marshmallow> cause it has a sword
04:41:11 * marshmallow shrugs
04:41:22 <edodes> eh, they'll usually take it out if it isn't
04:42:37 <marshmallow> true
04:49:16 <EDSGD> Hey we're not in the same timezone :D
04:49:34 <edodes> You mean there are people who don't live in my world?
04:49:46 <EDSGD> Yes.
04:49:59 <edodes> my wit has gone down the drain
04:50:00 <edodes> too tired
04:50:28 <marshmallow> <-- EST time zone
04:50:33 <marshmallow> it's nearly 1a
04:50:45 <edodes> ditto
05:16:58 <marshmallow> gah damn it...
05:17:06 <marshmallow> i think we went overboard with the presents
05:17:15 <marshmallow> probably gonna have to remove half of it
05:17:21 <marshmallow> otherwise it'll cost $80 to ship -.-
05:32:20 <EDSGD> Good Night
05:33:35 <marshmallow> gnite!

14:22:13 <marshmallow> does anyone here uses behance?
14:22:21 <marshmallow> i'm confused on how it works
14:29:25 <medos> sign up
14:29:27 <medos> post stuff
14:29:31 <medos> receive fame
14:30:58 <marshmallow> like 1 design per project?
14:31:06 <marshmallow> or should I group a bunch together?
14:31:53 <marshmallow> I see more people use it for photography?
14:33:07 <medos> there's one rule on behance
14:33:42 <medos> if you're making visual creative stuff
14:34:04 <medos> then you are allowed to post stuff on behance
14:34:30 <marshmallow> kk
14:34:34 <marshmallow> do you have one?
14:35:17 <medos> http://www.behance.net/MichaelBuck
14:35:27 <medos> Your portfolio is empty.
14:35:27 <medos> Uploading work is fast and easy, start now!
14:35:30 <medos> WHEEEE
14:36:19 <marshmallow> YOU WOULD
14:36:25 <marshmallow> sign up for an account and not post anything
14:36:28 <marshmallow> shesh
14:36:59 <marshmallow> I'm just thinking... formatting wise, how do I wanna do it
14:37:15 <marshmallow> I don't understand why people like to take pics of their stuff sideways
14:37:25 <marshmallow> as if it's "cooler" and more "artsy"
14:37:39 <medos> space limitations
14:38:26 <medos> you're able to see more stuff while keeping it a little mysterious and interesting at the same time
14:38:48 <marshmallow> idk
14:39:04 <marshmallow> not gonna lie, I feel like people are hiding something whenever they do it like that
14:39:25 <marshmallow> aka, making something bad/boring into something worth more then it really is
14:39:27 <medos> SEE!
14:39:28 <medos> :D
14:39:36 <medos> mysterious all the way
14:39:54 <marshmallow> hmr...  I guess I should go do that
14:39:58 <medos> no
14:40:03 <marshmallow> I made a bunch of t-shirts
14:40:09 <marshmallow> I can take sideways shots of them
14:40:16 <marshmallow> instead of letting the design speak for itself
14:40:19 <marshmallow> holla!
14:40:21 <marshmallow> =D
14:41:00 <medos> to be fair
14:41:08 <medos> there are shittons of situations
14:41:20 <medos> where the myspace-designer-angle is useful
14:41:40 <medos> e.g.: dribbble limits you to 400x300px for a shot
14:41:54 <medos> how the hell are you going to show a work in progress website as a whole
14:42:02 <marshmallow> true
14:42:03 <medos> myspace angle
14:42:27 <marshmallow> OOH!  THAT is why i probably intuitively don't like the angle shots
14:42:38 <medos> lol
14:42:52 <medos> you don't like the myspace angle? :(
14:42:57 <medos> .gis myspace angle
14:43:01 <medos> NSFW MAYBE
14:43:07 <medos> NSFL
14:43:09 <marshmallow> then i'm not opening it
14:43:10 <medos> D:
14:43:16 <medos> it's a guy without a top
14:43:25 <medos> not doing the myspace angle
14:43:46 <marshmallow> eh, if it's NSFW, I'm not touching it
14:43:58 <marshmallow> better safe then sorry
14:44:01 <medos> yeah
14:44:05 <medos> you're not missing anything
14:44:30 <medos> another reason for the tiltview thing is
14:44:32 <marshmallow> dunno
14:44:39 <marshmallow> hot guys without shirts =(
14:44:41 <medos> that it disconnects from the website itself
14:45:00 <medos> it's worksafe but not nice to look at
14:45:25 <medos> angleshot preview of a website vs straight up preview shot of a website
14:45:44 <medos> straight up preview will look like it's just a box within a box
14:46:11 <marshmallow> i clicked =.=
14:46:15 <marshmallow> why you make me click -.-
14:46:26 <medos> pc display (box 1) -> browser (box 2) -> shot window (box 3)
14:46:27 <medos> hahahaha
14:46:38 <medos> (16:44:41) (marshmallow): hot guys without shirts =( !
14:46:57 <marshmallow> -.-
14:48:14 <medos> you should photoshop that shirt you made
14:48:17 <medos> on that guy
14:49:04 <marshmallow> haha, no
14:49:20 <marshmallow> besides, it would get cut off!
14:49:37 <medos> ask the guy for a full bodyshot then
14:49:50 <marshmallow> nah
14:49:52 <marshmallow> i'm good
14:50:36 <marshmallow> he's no alexander skarsgard <-- sexiest actor everrrrrrrr
14:50:58 <medos> .gis alexander skarsgard
14:51:10 <medos> OH COME ON

15:04:35 <marshmallow> secretly
15:04:37 <marshmallow> lol
15:07:35 <medos> never seen gossip girl
15:09:02 <medos> if i had to pick an actress though i'd say natalie portman
15:09:04 <medos> i think
15:09:41 <medos> or olivia wilde
15:10:39 <marshmallow> ooh, they're both really good actresses 
15:10:45 <marshmallow> idk which is my favorite actress
15:10:53 <marshmallow> hehehe
15:10:54 <marshmallow> choosing a favorite actor is a lot easier
15:11:44 <medos> sexiest actor - benicio del toro (no homo)
15:12:13 <medos> fav actor in general is Sam Rockwell
15:12:14 <medos> derp
15:13:10 <medos> Sat i'm downloading that madeon set right now, i hope it's worth it
15:13:36 <Sat> well i love that guy
15:14:13 <marshmallow> i've never seen benicio
15:14:13 <marshmallow> woops XD
15:14:57 <medos> benicio actually looks like a guy, not a fashion model
15:15:31 <marshmallow> skarsgard is an actor...
15:15:42 <Sat> im a big fan of facial hair
15:15:45 <marshmallow> he's on HBO
15:15:55 <marshmallow> =D
15:16:23 <marshmallow> i'm not a huge fan of his movie stuff though
15:16:28 <marshmallow> battleships was stupid
15:17:28 <medos> meh
15:17:57 <marshmallow> i've met him once
15:18:15 <marshmallow> pure awesome =D
15:18:52 <marshmallow> you tend to see a bunch of famous people here and there when you're in nyc a lot
15:18:59 <marshmallow> saw obama yesterday
15:19:33 <Sat> i saw sue barker yesterday !
15:22:49 <marshmallow> coolios
15:22:57 <marshmallow> i didn't see obama by choice
15:23:14 <medos> closed your eyes?
15:23:15 <marshmallow> they closed off the streets I needed to cross to get home
15:23:33 <marshmallow> so, I basically had to wait for him to pass so I could go home
15:24:08 <marshmallow> when obama is in nyc, everything is gridlocked
15:24:15 <marshmallow> it's kinda crazy
15:35:33 <Sat> would have been more curious about your obama story expect i was eating
15:37:17 <Sat> sont know why any sane non rich person in america would vote republican, not saying democrats are great, just republicans really suck
15:37:30 <Sat> don't*
15:38:35 <medos> oh dear
15:39:39 <marshmallow> not much of a story.  obama came.  streets closed.  waited till he drove by....  and about 30 other cop cars / patrolers with giant guns
15:40:02 <marshmallow> it was faster then the last time I ran into obama
15:40:25 <marshmallow> another time I was picking up a friend from the airport.  he landed the same time obama did
15:40:29 <marshmallow> that was a nightmare.
15:41:05 <marshmallow> highways were closed off for obama.  it was semi-ridiculous since I was going West and Obama was going East...  but they still felt the need to close BOTH sides of the highway
15:41:23 <Sat> obama is at the airport. "what? A bomber is at the airport.EEEEEEEEKKKKKKK"
15:41:27 <Sat> bad joke warning
15:42:04 <marshmallow> gah
15:42:21 <marshmallow> obama added about 2ish extra hours to my airport trip
15:42:38 <marshmallow> yesterday, it was only like 10ish extra minutes
15:44:37 <Sat> selfish bastard!
15:44:45 <Sat> obama that is
15:44:55 <marshmallow> lol
15:45:39 <marshmallow> well, 10 mins kinda made a big difference yesterday
15:46:07 <marshmallow> i got caught in a huge downpour
15:46:20 <Sat> do you live in manhattern?
15:46:27 <marshmallow> negatory
15:46:31 <marshmallow> i work there

18:24:19 <EDSGD_> Besides you did have other stuff going on.
18:24:56 <EDSGD_> WIsh I could have entered. Seemed  like something I could've had fun with. :-)

18:25:19 <medos> wanted to robo-knight-ify him first
18:25:22 <medos> but that got annoying
18:26:06 <EDSGD_> LOL Hey I have access to 50 shutterstock downloads.
18:26:23 <EDSGD_> If you guys want to pick one let me know and I'll download it.
18:26:37 <marshmallow> i got thinkstock.  hundreds
18:26:42 <marshmallow> let me know too
18:26:43 <marshmallow> =P

18:27:00 <medos> :P
18:27:09 <marshmallow> ?
18:27:10 <EDSGD_> :)
18:27:21 <marshmallow> oh, the challenge
18:28:23 <medos> we could do something other than just randomly photoshopping a pic
18:28:27 <medos> but i wouldn't know what
18:28:36 <Sat> rebrand!
18:29:08 <Sat> or just brand. tis fun
18:30:09 <EDSGD_> Won't that take longer than usual for rebrand.

19:48:00 <medos> i drag a box get a window showing me what i captured
19:48:06 <medos> if i like it i hit okaaaay
19:48:17 <marshmallow> the only thing I really like about snagit is the rolling screen feature.  So, it will auto scroll and capture the ENTIRE screen
19:48:19 <medos> and it uploads + puts the imgur link in my clipboard
19:48:42 <medos> + snagit costs moneeh :P
19:48:59 <marshmallow> a lot of ppl got snagit in my office
19:49:01 <marshmallow> =p
19:49:18 <marshmallow> i wouldn't buy it though personally
19:49:25 <Sat> that upload to imgur feature is great
19:49:27 <marshmallow> especially with a nifty print scrn button on the comptuer

20:37:33 <whippersnapper> Question about hinting vs. anti-aliasing.
20:37:42 <whippersnapper> Hinting = turning pixels on/off
20:37:59 <whippersnapper> AA = using different values to approximate edge fall-off?
20:45:40 <whippersnapper> .tell TheWhisper http://emilychang.com/2010/03/ipad-templates-and-stencils/
20:46:28 <whippersnapper> .tell TheWhisper http://paperpencilpixel.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/ipad-grid/
20:49:11 <medos> uhhhhm
20:49:16 <medos> ohhh
20:49:21 <medos> wtf
20:49:22 <whippersnapper> ?
20:49:44 <medos> most sneaky nickname
20:49:46 <whippersnapper> lol
20:50:04 <whippersnapper> Was my analysis of hinting vs AA correct?
20:50:29 <whippersnapper> .tell TheWhisper http://asidemag.com/grid/
20:50:57 <medos> pixel hinting = http://i.imgur.com/eden9.png
20:51:13 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/fmiQB.png
20:51:13 <whippersnapper> Isn't that a mix of hinting + AA?
20:51:39 <whippersnapper> Cuz the hinting would be aligning pixels to the grid 
20:51:44 <whippersnapper> but the aa would be the shades of grey
20:51:51 <whippersnapper> lol shades of grey
20:52:08 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/eItu3.png
20:52:15 <Sat> that sounds logical to me
20:52:54 <whippersnapper> I see sub-pixel hinting in that last one
20:53:14 <Sat> so hinting is binary and aa has the value. to copy what you just said :p
20:53:19 <whippersnapper> i.e. when i had those kerning problems lol
20:53:24 <whippersnapper> I think so, but not sure
20:54:52 <medos> pixel hinting = manual and wanted or not wanted
20:55:06 <medos> anti aliasing = no way to influence , just on or off
20:55:20 <medos> if it's "crisp" , "strong" or any other technique
20:55:26 <medos> they really just have that one setting on or off
20:55:35 <whippersnapper> what
20:55:42 <medos> i'm just trying to confuse you
20:55:45 <medos> it's what i do best
20:55:49 <whippersnapper> Yes
20:55:58 <whippersnapper> You're talking about in Photoshop
20:56:07 <Sat> hinting can be automatic
20:56:08 <medos> anywhere
20:56:09 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Uvsgb.png
20:56:26 <whippersnapper> hm
20:56:33 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/fEVuE.png
20:56:45 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Nxddy.png
20:57:17 <medos> really only changed one setting, the first pure pixel one is no aliasing
20:57:25 <medos> *anti aliasing
20:59:48 <whippersnapper> You're not saying anything that makes sense.
21:00:01 <whippersnapper> :P
21:00:05 <whippersnapper> What're you working on anyway?
21:00:45 <medos> confusing you
21:00:47 <medos> i'm almost done
21:01:11 <medos> 1. anti aliasing IS pixel hinting
21:01:48 <medos> 2. If someone talks about pixel hinting i would presume that he manually (!) rearranges or moves vector points to either achieve manual pixel hinting or remove pixel hinting that he did not want
21:02:04 <medos> because just talking about anti aliasing sounds like it's the push of a button
21:02:45 <whippersnapper> wait
21:02:49 <Sat> Postscript fonts uses a automated hinting system. the scaling is handelded by the software.
21:02:59 <whippersnapper> How are they the same
21:03:12 <medos> succesfully confused
21:03:25 <Sat> truetype doesnt

21:03:40 <whippersnapper> https://freddie.witherden.org/pages/font-rasterisation/#font-hinting
21:03:58 <whippersnapper> This says hinting = fitting outlines to the grid
21:04:06 <whippersnapper> and it's only binary
21:04:09 <whippersnapper> on/off
21:04:19 <medos> lol
21:04:22 <whippersnapper> while AA is using shades
21:04:24 <medos> are you drunk
21:04:28 <whippersnapper> ?

21:48:29 <vadoo> Sat: wow, this camera was really eyeopener
21:49:05 <vadoo> the video that show how it can be used to look around corners is mind-blowing too
21:49:31 <Sat> yup its pretty basic with regards to the round the corners aspect, but it works!
21:50:57 <whippersnapper> What about flat lenses
21:51:00 <whippersnapper> that's mindblowing
21:51:07 <whippersnapper> well
21:51:08 <whippersnapper> not really
21:51:10 <whippersnapper> just really cool
21:52:19 <medos> whippersnapper if i'd take any photos i'd send the film to a friend of mine
21:52:32 <whippersnapper> And he does it for you?
21:52:32 <medos> who has the equipment
21:52:36 <whippersnapper> Aw
21:52:42 <medos> only black and white though
21:52:55 <whippersnapper> That takes all the fun out of shooting film though!
21:52:55 <medos> or wait
21:53:00 <Sat> just realised that link i sent didnt even have the ted talk on it >.< the information is covered and im sure you could find it if you wanted anyway
21:53:01 <medos> no idea tbh.
21:53:02 <whippersnapper> The best part imo is developing them
21:53:08 <medos> is it
21:53:16 <whippersnapper>  yup
21:53:17 <medos> i'm not so sure about that
21:53:22 <whippersnapper> "IMO"

22:23:11 <medos> see
22:23:16 <whippersnapper> If I finish my file
22:23:19 <whippersnapper> and give it to you
22:23:23 <whippersnapper> then you presume it's done?
22:25:01 <cubic> the golfer guy had a weird face in the pic
22:25:13 <cubic> made me laugh 4 times
22:25:49 <medos> updated blog
22:25:59 <cubic> salad
22:26:03 <whippersnapper> So how come cubic can enter now
22:26:09 <whippersnapper> but if I give you mine now
22:26:11 <whippersnapper> I can't
22:26:17 <medos> did you try?
22:26:31 <whippersnapper> Try what?
22:26:45 <whippersnapper> To give you mine or to do it?
22:26:48 <medos> not making this so complicated and just giving me a file without making excuses for half an hour
22:26:57 <medos> and then pondering the morality of random file handovers
22:26:58 <whippersnapper> lol
22:27:24 <whippersnapper> Me saying "Hey, is the challenge still enterable? I didn't finish mine yet." 
22:27:29 <whippersnapper> does not equal complication
22:27:35 <whippersnapper> Your obtuse answer does :)
22:28:11 <EDSGD_> Just submit something whippersnapper
22:28:12 <EDSGD_> :)
22:28:17 <medos> (!)
22:28:41 <medos> or EDSGD will have the honor of adding a black mspaint dick to the golfer
22:28:49 <whippersnapper> lol whose is the boat one?
22:28:57 <whippersnapper> ah azraek
22:28:59 <whippersnapper> *arae
22:29:05 <whippersnapper> fucking shitty mac keyboard
22:30:11 <whippersnapper> fuck
22:30:29 <whippersnapper> Question for you guys
22:30:41 <whippersnapper> If you wake up and are very productive from like
22:30:44 <whippersnapper> 8-3
22:30:59 <whippersnapper> do you then find yourself completely able to do even the smallest of tasks after 3 pm?
22:31:04 <whippersnapper> *unable
22:31:17 <medos> like typing?
22:31:21 <whippersnapper> lol
22:31:25 <whippersnapper> Like chores, work, etc
22:31:36 <medos> bad habit from
22:31:38 <medos> ?whisper
22:31:54 <whippersnapper> Hm
22:31:59 <whippersnapper> I don't think so, to be honest.
22:32:08 <whippersnapper> It used to be that I was not productive at any point during the day.
22:32:19 <whippersnapper> But now I'm actually able to be productive early in the day
22:32:29 <whippersnapper> But then I experience this huge drop off
22:32:35 <whippersnapper> and I don't know if this is a normal thing
22:32:48 <whippersnapper> or whether it's related to like my medicine wearing off or something
22:34:11 <medos> maybe?
22:34:40 <medos> i don't even know what i would answer to now
22:36:34 <whippersnapper> [18:32] <whippersnapper> But then I experience this huge drop off [18:32] <whippersnapper> and I don't know if this is a normal thing
22:36:38 <whippersnapper> ^
22:37:06 <medos> oh nah
22:37:08 <medos> it's normal
22:37:13 <medos> my medicine stop working after 3pm too
22:38:29 <cubic> what kind of medicine y'alls taking?
22:38:51 <whippersnapper> I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.
22:38:58 <whippersnapper> And ADD meds
22:39:54 <cubic> whenever i take tat stuff i feel it all day. it gives me superpowers
22:40:29 <whippersnapper> I assume you don't have ADD though :P
22:40:44 <cubic> i don't.
22:40:44 <cubic> well
22:40:46 <cubic> not diagnosed. 
22:40:51 <whippersnapper> That's what they all say 
22:40:55 <whippersnapper> ;)
22:40:55 <cubic> i know
22:41:09 <whippersnapper> "hey bro I don't like working do you think i have add?"
22:41:11 <cubic> i rationalize my recreational drug use by saying it's undiagnosed
22:41:34 <whippersnapper> "hey bro i was on the phone with my mom and using my computer and drawing a picture at the same time do you think I have add?"
22:41:51 <cubic> i just cleaned my room
22:41:52 <cubic> i was like
22:41:54 <whippersnapper> "hey bro i sleep 2 hours a night and then am unable to work during the day do you think I have add?"
22:41:56 <cubic> ocd  crazy
22:44:00 <medos> when is 3pm for you?
22:44:02 <medos> right now?
22:44:08 <medos> timezonefuckery
22:45:11 <medos> D:
22:45:25 <whippersnapper> uh
22:45:28 <whippersnapper> no
22:45:32 <whippersnapper> it's 6:45 pm now
22:46:38 <medos> so roughly two hours ago your productivity dropped?
22:47:01 <whippersnapper> uh
22:47:07 <whippersnapper> yeah
22:47:16 <whippersnapper> but it's like every day
22:47:16 <medos> and you joined this channel roughly two hours ago?
22:47:23 <whippersnapper> lol
22:47:24 <medos> is that roughly right?
22:47:31 <whippersnapper> Yes
22:47:33 <medos> cool
22:47:35 <whippersnapper> but they're unrelated
22:47:36 <medos> it's deffo your meds
22:47:40 <whippersnapper> Nah
22:47:45 <medos> i'm sure of it
22:47:49 <whippersnapper> 1) I was in class when I joined and I was productive in calss
22:47:52 <whippersnapper> *class
22:48:03 <whippersnapper> 2) over the weekend I was productive on both saturday and sunday
22:48:07 <whippersnapper> and I was in the irc the entire time
22:48:15 <whippersnapper> same thing with monday too
22:49:02 <whippersnapper> whoa
22:49:09 <whippersnapper> This is really interesting
22:49:27 <whippersnapper> "In ADHD Children, hyperfocus allows them to participate in computer games or watch high-action movies - but at a cost. The amount of energy being used makes them very irritable. If a parent interrupts the computer game or movie with a question, a call for lunch, or a request - the ADHD Children is likely to explode in a burst of verbal or physical aggression. His or her concentration has been broken and that neurochemic
22:49:36 <whippersnapper> rected at the interrupting source. "
22:50:11 <medos> (23:00:08) (whippersnapper): What're you working on anyway?
22:50:11 <medos> (23:00:47) (medos): confusing you
22:50:11 <medos> (23:00:50) (medos): i'm almost done
22:50:14 <whippersnapper> Y'know, I just realized how little I've actually taken the time to research ADD
22:50:14 <medos> :D!
22:50:33 <whippersnapper> I really need to take some time to do some deep study on it
22:51:09 <whippersnapper> "ADHD is not characterized by a child's inability to pay attention, but rather is marked by his inability to control his attention. A child with ADHD has great difficulty paying attention to tasks that are not immediately rewarding, that require effort."
22:51:14 <medos> yo EDSGD wanna jump in for TheWhisper this week?
22:51:16 <medos> gogo golfer
22:51:32 <medos> he's busy with behavior studies
22:52:37 <whippersnapper> "The difficulty I have is acknowledging that some things I hyperfocus on, are not vital, and I really shouldn't be that focused on them."
22:52:39 <whippersnapper> Sounds like me

22:55:13 <medos> i would mention that reddit makes your problems worse but i've done that often enough now
22:55:24 <medos> so go on with yer digging :P
22:55:26 <medos> hey Kocho
22:55:32 <Kocho> gutten morgan
22:55:35 <Kocho> sp?
22:55:48 <whippersnapper> Medos, I'm barely on reddit these days
22:55:59 <whippersnapper> So it's not really relevant 
22:56:19 <whippersnapper> And to be honest, I don't think it ever was. Reddit's just a distraction I can latch onto, but it's not the problem itself.
22:56:19 <medos> i know
22:56:41 <whippersnapper> I can get distracted and hyperfocus on anything really
22:56:54 <whippersnapper> Sometimes I'll just like look at my hands
22:57:02 <whippersnapper> and spend 10 minutes studying the lines and pores
22:57:12 <whippersnapper> lol
22:57:24 <whippersnapper> That sounds super depressing hahaha
22:58:03 <whippersnapper> Also, one thing I've noticed is that like
22:58:10 <whippersnapper> the past few days during my productive periods
22:58:14 <whippersnapper> I could be in IRC
22:58:28 <whippersnapper> and not get sidetracked into discussing unimportant shit for 2 hours
22:58:36 <whippersnapper> I just realized that
22:58:37 <whippersnapper> woo
22:59:06 <whippersnapper> Ha, some dude on this ADD forum calls getting sidetracked "sidetripping"
22:59:07 <whippersnapper> I like that
22:59:20 <Kocho> I'm just going to restart
22:59:26 <medos> if you ever need someone to write your biography i'll just collect your logs
23:00:00 <medos> Kocho how should i tell the guy that Attention! is not working?
23:00:08 <Kocho> eh?
23:00:13 <Kocho> what do you mean not working?
23:00:32 <whippersnapper> thanks medos lol
23:00:44 <medos> Attention Pay It!
23:00:49 <medos> crashes
23:00:59 <Kocho> the logo comes up at the start
23:01:01 <medos> before i can do anything
23:01:02 <medos> yeah
23:01:03 <Kocho> then it goes black
23:01:13 <Kocho> it should still load after that
23:01:17 <Kocho> I'm not sure why it goes black
23:01:22 <Kocho> anyway ill brb
23:01:22 <medos> logo -> black -> gamecenter login overlay -> black black -> homescreen
23:01:24 <medos> aye
23:01:42 <medos> gamecenter login overlay = "welcome back "
23:02:26 <Kocho> logo > black > Welcome Back > Black > then the animation should take place
23:03:05 <Kocho> then > home screen
23:03:09 <Kocho> it should end up working
23:03:13 <Kocho> lol
23:03:15 <Kocho> anyway brb
23:03:36 <whippersnapper> hahaha
23:03:39 <whippersnapper> "* Please don't make fun of my many lists, day timers and notes that don't seem to keep me organized."
23:03:47 <whippersnapper> That's from their like "ADD manifesto" thing
23:03:58 <whippersnapper> Y'all can make fun of me all the time though ;)
23:04:03 <medos> you sound like you're bathing in excitement about your pseudo-illness
23:04:14 <medos> i am making fun of you all the time
23:04:21 <medos> sometimes you even stop going bonkers
23:04:29 <medos> sometimes not :(

23:14:54 <Kocho> ill let him know
23:14:57 <medos> yup
23:15:39 <whippersnapper> Heh
23:15:54 <whippersnapper> Seems that hating small talk is related to ADD
23:15:56 <medos> Kocho it stays black for about 10 seconds
23:23:27 <whippersnapper> "The toughest part is still coming down. After that 8-10 hour mark, I sometimes feel drained. I'm very unproductive in the evenings now"
23:23:36 <whippersnapper> I'm gonna call my doc and talk with her tomorrow
23:24:41 <medos> i thought it wasn't your meds
23:24:56 <whippersnapper> ?
23:24:58 <whippersnapper> Who said that?
23:25:33 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/QWA0K.png
23:25:56 <whippersnapper> lol
23:25:57 <whippersnapper> that nah
23:26:00 <whippersnapper> was in relation to
23:26:24 <whippersnapper> oh
23:26:30 <whippersnapper> I thought you were sarcastically saying it was def my meds
23:26:38 <medos> no?
23:26:50 <whippersnapper> I thought you really meant that it was the IRC
23:26:50 <whippersnapper> lol
23:26:55 <whippersnapper> my bad
23:26:59 <medos> amphetamin based stuff has a half-life 6-10 hours
23:27:06 <medos> in yer body
23:29:08 <medos> and as amphetamines do
23:29:09 <whippersnapper> yeah
23:29:15 <medos> they power you out proportionally faster
23:29:17 <whippersnapper> yup
23:29:23 <medos> so you feel like a whole day after 6-10 hours
23:29:32 <whippersnapper> yup yup
23:29:41 <whippersnapper> except the problem is I'm not actually tired
23:29:53 <whippersnapper> I can still think fine
23:30:02 <whippersnapper> And physically I'm fine
23:30:05 <whippersnapper> I just can't do things
23:30:31 <whippersnapper> Honestly, I have no idea how I managed to produce a newspaper section every day when I worked at the paper lol
23:30:34 <medos> breathe?
23:31:26 <whippersnapper> What?
23:31:47 <medos> let's hope you can do that after 3pm
23:31:58 <medos> otherwise you'll be fucked reaaaaaaal soon
23:32:01 <whippersnapper> lol
23:32:11 <whippersnapper> Sometimes I'll forget to eat or drink
23:32:23 <medos> then your dose is too high
23:32:40 <medos> if you visit your doc tomorrow and demand a doublerefill-moreofit
23:32:43 <medos> you'll get worse
23:32:47 <medos> (serious)
23:32:56 <whippersnapper> Yeah
23:32:58 <whippersnapper> I know
23:33:01 <whippersnapper> That's the thing
23:33:05 <whippersnapper> My dose is already high
23:33:13 <whippersnapper> 30mg XR

23:37:06 <whippersnapper> I wish I could have a secretary for my life lol
23:38:55 <medos> minimizing the amount of input that may confuse you would be a start
23:39:00 <medos> as opposed to a secretary
23:39:02 <medos> reddit
