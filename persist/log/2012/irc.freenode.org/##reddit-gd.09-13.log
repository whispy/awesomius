00:01:19 <medos> yeah
00:01:44 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/AsuAN.png
00:01:52 <Kocho> it feels like "we'll show 'em how its made instead of all the new features which should be here"
00:01:58 <medos> they all seem a little less happy to behonest
00:02:02 <Kocho> damn

00:02:32 <Kocho> the great thing about the previous one was that it clipped onto my shorts when i run and cycle
00:02:49 <medos> the new one has round buttons
00:02:52 <medos> to tap
00:02:57 <Kocho> amazing
00:03:10 <Kocho> that makes them harder
00:03:12 <Kocho> to tap

03:08:46 <TheWhisper> Medos, FIOS = fiber optic shit
03:08:48 <TheWhisper> from Verizon
03:08:58 <TheWhisper> essentially no different than every other internet service
03:09:03 <TheWhisper> but they give better speeds
03:09:07 <TheWhisper> and it's more reliable
03:09:13 <TheWhisper> so it's not essentially no different
03:09:14 <EDSGD> but its shit 
03:09:17 <TheWhisper> it's also $$$
03:09:23 <marshmallow> i like verizon fios more for the cable

03:13:11 <TheWhisper> Medos said they don't talk about celebrities on it
03:13:16 <EDSGD> Europe <3
03:13:18 <TheWhisper> and I was like 'the legends are true'
03:14:00 <TheWhisper> I think he specifically said
03:14:02 <TheWhisper> something like
03:14:10 <TheWhisper> "they would never talk about britney's vagina on it'
03:14:12 <TheWhisper> or something

09:00:43 <medos> Hey Sat what's up? :)
09:03:05 <Sat> Hey Medos, just at costas coffee, decided i needed to get my shit together a bit better so i'm coming up with a business plan, deadlines for a website and just general plans for time management
09:08:02 <medos> do it like this guy http://vimeo.com/49155684
09:10:08 -!- acous [u.658@unaffiliated/acous] has joined ##reddit-gd
09:10:44 <Sat> can tell your a pro redditor, you can provide a link for every response
09:15:05 <medos> haha, I barely visit reddit, i always get the urge to write long, exhaustive explanatory replies which yield no replies and just an ocassional downvote because i was straining the attention span of the average redditor.
09:15:06 <medos> :p
09:16:16 <Sat> sorry tl dr
09:16:33 <medos> ?dwi
09:16:41 <medos> At least you can't downvote. herpderp
09:16:49 <Sat> lol
09:19:16 <Azra-el> medos.... computer restarted last night .. .lost my ps challenge wip yey
09:19:25 <medos> cs6?
09:19:28 <medos> autosave?
09:19:34 <medos> every 10 minutes?
09:19:42 <medos> fire it up and it'll show a sexy restore bar?
09:20:16 <Azra-el> omg yessssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
09:20:16 <Azra-el> :D
09:20:20 <medos> Yeah.
09:20:25 <medos> Now comes the moment where you realie
09:20:28 <medos> *realize
09:20:37 <medos> Illustrator cs6 does not have such a feature.
09:20:54 <Azra-el> yeah i know :(
09:20:57 <Azra-el> stupid illustrator
09:23:10 <medos> Sat what's the business plan for?
09:24:33 <Sat> my business, freelancing, i need a structure, better management, to think about advertising and branding myself.
09:25:18 <medos> Branding sounds painful.
09:26:19 <medos> ?portfolio
09:26:27 <medos> ?freelance
09:26:28 <Sat> yup, as im selling myself i will have to think about how to express personality whilst not going too informal. also need a good name still :(
09:26:42 <medos> Those links might help?
09:27:13 <medos> haha, not going too informal
09:28:42 <Azra-el> you like rem medos :P
09:29:09 <medos> i have written long and eloquent personal messages, shorter "hey here's my stuff" ones and messages like "i have no clue how to do that but i'm interested and usually know my shit"
09:29:43 <medos> third one works best for me
09:30:03 <Azra-el> medos .. im looking at mixture now... but you should look at this .. .http://youtu.be/bUR_eUVcABg prepere to get your mind blown :)
09:32:39 <medos> third one literally involves swearing and ghetto slang
09:32:51 <medos> watching linux video
09:35:20 <Azra-el> look at that xiki dude
09:36:34 <medos> Where's the download link?
09:38:57 <Azra-el> github on their page.. watcha think of it?
09:39:58 <medos> Looks like i could fail three times at once using a terminal.
09:40:13 <Sat> my communication depends on the client. do you use emoticons in e-mails with clients?
09:40:15 <medos> I'm not good with grep berries.
09:41:14 <medos> Sat I tend to send 1-2 emails at most before gchatting/skyping/livemessenger talking to them.
09:42:12 <medos> That usually requires a certain amount susceptibility to not appear clingy/needy
09:42:25 <medos> or presuming that the deal is 100% contractually fixed.
09:42:39 <medos> if they think that they'll never agree to actually talk :P
09:43:30 <medos> People tend to act more casual if you convey casual and normal well enough
09:44:11 <Sat> balance between coming across more friendly, motivated, and interested in their projcet. and unprofessional. 
09:44:21 <medos> no
09:44:48 <medos> just failing a lot till you figure out what telltale signs there are for certain types of people
09:45:42 <Sat> ye i meant to me i feel their is a balance with regards to communicating and using emoticons and similar casual chat.
09:46:07 <Sat> and like you said depends on who you are speaking with
09:46:12 <medos> yup
09:46:32 <medos> some people just don't use smileys at all, that's where chatting helps a lot
09:46:37 <medos> it's an actual conversation
09:46:51 <medos> as opposed to 1hour constructed and spellchecked email
09:47:14 <Sat> indeed
09:47:16 <medos> if they don't use smileys i'd feel weird using them
09:47:20 <medos> so i tend not to
09:47:22 <medos> just because
09:48:03 <Sat> same, they always have to open the "smiley window" so to speak! 
09:49:11 <medos> that sounded like you're making a checklist with buzzwords for each point
09:50:03 <Sat> huh :o
09:50:07 <medos> haha
09:50:20 <medos> i just thought smiley window is a funny term
09:50:28 <medos> :P
09:50:43 <medos> grown ups and business men aren't anymore serious than anyone else, they're just better at hiding their inapropriate behaviour
09:51:01 <Sat> accpeted! btw i will be disconnected in a few mins as my laptop battery sucks

09:53:53 <medos> if your battery dies i'll just presume you'll be back soon
09:54:03 <medos> soon being tomorrow or in a week or anytime
09:54:05 <Sat> ye i just wanted to give heads up incase i suddenly droped in middle of a convo
09:54:18 <medos> that happens daily
09:54:30 <Sat> noted
09:54:52 <medos> i hope i could help a bit
09:56:28 <medos> http://www.alistapart.com/topics/process/ <- bookmark this before your battery dies
09:56:29 <Sat> discussing anything always helps, especially if its with informed person(s)
09:57:08 <Sat> done
09:57:38 <medos> step two is checking the workflow, management part of those articles
09:58:03 <medos> more important than bookmarking but i won't force you to do so
09:58:49 <Sat> can do it later (2% battery)
09:59:46 <medos> poor coffee shop without a charger
09:59:58 <medos> turning off wireless lan usually saves battery life!
10:14:29 <medos> throwing a billion actually useful links at redditors is fun

14:29:15 <medos> oh lol
14:29:19 <medos> mine isn't vecteur
14:30:45 <marshmallow> NICE!
14:30:54 <Satz> vecor is ftw
14:30:55 <marshmallow> i'm totally going to need this in the near future for my projects

14:32:27 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobefiles/awesome.psd
14:32:34 <medos> ^ i like this one more
14:32:40 * marshmallow makes ads for apps we promote.  definitely going to need the new iphone =D
14:33:04 <medos> not an iphone but content-structure wise
14:33:23 <marshmallow> oooh
14:33:34 <marshmallow> is that free for commercial use or personal use only?
14:33:48 <medos> the iphone?
14:33:55 <marshmallow> the awesome.psd file
14:34:16 * marshmallow just wanna know which folder i should save it in
14:34:43 <medos> http://dribbble.com/shots/98888-iPhone-icons
14:34:49 <medos> go look it up
14:34:51 <medos> no idea tbh
14:38:44 <Satz> can you do that last one on the iphone os? (maps) 
14:39:14 <marshmallow> hmr...  i have no idea too
14:39:18 <marshmallow> i'll just save it in my personal only folder
14:40:24 <medos> nope
14:40:39 <medos> it's a rounded box
14:40:54 <medos> no transparency inside that box and no elements going over the edge
14:41:45 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobefiles/iPhoneWireFrame-OCD-011.ai
14:42:02 <medos> ^ feel free to grab my template
14:42:07 <medos> never really used it ;|
14:42:11 <medos> and now it's outdated
14:42:35 <Satz> one other thing ive wondered is does apple give you an "intant gloss" option for your icon or do designers always have to do it on ps
14:42:56 <medos> .g apple hig icon gloss
14:43:41 <medos> Satz do you have an iphone?
14:43:45 <Satz> aha thought so
14:43:50 <Satz> yup iphone 4
14:44:05 <medos> if you open http://www.theryanford.com/new/icon_fry/
14:44:07 <medos> in safari
14:44:13 <medos> and select "add to home screen"
14:44:35 <medos> you'll have that icon as an actual icon like it would look for an app on your homescreen
14:45:37 <medos> those icons can either be "hey-i-don't-need-gloss" setting or "hey-gimme-some-default-gloss" setting
14:46:19 <medos> wuaaaaa
14:46:30 <marshmallow> lol, your template hates cs4
14:46:35 <marshmallow> *cs5
14:46:37 <marshmallow> just saying
14:47:55 <marshmallow> that fry is silly
14:48:06 <marshmallow> pass
14:52:29 <medos> blergh
14:52:58 <Satz> i dont get it whats special out adding that fry image as a icon? 
14:53:21 <Satz> about* and yup your template got rejected by my cs5
14:53:51 <medos> lol
14:53:57 <medos> uhm
14:54:01 <medos> let's say you're a designer
14:54:08 <medos> working on an app icon
14:54:33 <medos> instead of telling your developer "hey i have updated the app icon please implement that image and send me a new testbuild"
14:54:45 <medos> you can just use that html file
14:54:48 <medos> to check
14:55:05 <medos> before sending 20 revisions for 20 beta updates
14:56:42 <medos> ?appicon
14:57:26 <medos> laptop displays usually have higher gamma and aren't retina (unless you got the newest mbp)
14:57:40 <medos> so it's tough to judge how the thing will look on an iphone screen
14:58:02 <Satz> you can use his page to test your icon?
14:58:24 <medos> not really
14:58:41 <medos> just downloading the website
14:58:44 <Satz> oh sry that html file
14:58:51 <medos> exchanging the .png file
14:58:55 <medos> and hosting that on dropbox
14:58:58 <medos> or anywhere else
14:59:03 <medos> to add to your homescreen
14:59:26 <Satz> missed you saying html file
15:02:41 * marshmallow is confused
15:03:33 <marshmallow> nvm
15:05:56 <marshmallow> http://i.imgur.com/xkHiN.jpg <--  LOL!
15:06:37 <medos> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/icon/awesome.htm
15:07:30 <marshmallow> ooooooh
15:07:35 <Satz> cool
15:07:35 <marshmallow> well, now i wish i had safari...
15:07:42 <medos> and an iphone
15:07:48 <medos> herpaderp
15:09:20 <marshmallow> well, i have an ipod
15:09:23 <marshmallow> same thing
15:09:34 <marshmallow> and an ipad
15:09:38 <medos> derp didn't work
15:09:40 <medos> oh
15:09:40 <medos> yeah
15:09:49 <medos> oh it DID work
15:09:50 <medos> yaaaay
15:10:36 <marshmallow> i'll check it at home
15:10:47 <marshmallow> mostly cause my ipod will probably only find wifi at home
15:10:48 <marshmallow> lol
15:13:32 <medos> eh, corners aren't perfect
15:13:36 <medos> but that's me using the rounded export
15:13:48 <medos> was enough to demonstrate why random fries on the internet can be awesome

15:33:37 <Satz> i saw a timelapse painting yesterday and i couldnt work out how the painter made an effect happen from one frame to the next. 
15:33:50 <Satz> https://www.dropbox.com/s/m0vqrkmp0h2mnx1/Void-Sphere.jpg
15:33:57 <Satz> to https://www.dropbox.com/s/wqvnj4zt0n43zri/Void-Sphere-2.jpg
15:34:50 <Satz> happened so fast i thought it might a filter
15:37:25 <marshmallow> idk why but your dropbox doesn't want to load on my computer
15:39:47 <Satz> will be my fault, sec
15:41:50 <medos> sometimes people cut stuff out
15:41:52 <medos> or
15:42:00 <medos> timelapse tool is set to every X seconds
15:42:12 <Satz> https://www.dropbox.com/s/m0vqrkmp0h2mnx1/Void-Sphere.jpg if this doesnt work then tbh i dont know why its not working :(
15:42:14 <medos> and that difference you see there is just an activated/deactivated layer
15:42:27 <medos> you should put your stuff into your public folder
15:42:36 <medos> and then right click -> copy public link
15:42:45 <medos> so it's a direct .jpg link
15:43:02 <Satz> cool

15:44:22 <medos> i usually keep my long-term reddit pics in dropbox before
15:44:30 <medos> hell you can throw a html website on there
15:44:34 <medos> which is what i just did
15:45:14 * marshmallow shrugs
15:45:17 <Satz> ye noting your use of it made me realise how easy it is to use it
15:45:32 <marshmallow> i'm pretty sure i have a brush or two that can make that spiral thing
15:45:42 <marshmallow> then i would just play with the blending tools to get the glow right
15:45:50 <medos> i'm also pretty sure that's a layer he made earlier
15:45:58 <medos> and just upped the opacity
15:46:10 <medos> from 0 to 78
15:46:13 <Satz> ahhh ye 
15:46:56 <Satz> it happened so fast in the context of the painting i thought it was some instant filter that produced fantastic effects, this makes more sense

16:47:48 <CottonBalls> It also has TURBO MODDEEEE
16:47:52 <CottonBalls> Which just downloads songs really fast.
16:48:02 <CottonBalls> Technically "illegal". :P
16:48:22 <TheWhisper> ;)
16:49:01 <CottonBalls> But most good things in life are.
16:49:15 <TheWhisper> Like blowjobs
16:49:18 <TheWhisper> And showing calves
16:49:50 <CottonBalls> I am an ankle man myself.
16:54:13 <CottonBalls> So where do you guys stand on the whole "Mac" vs "Not Mac" debate that rages on in the design world?
16:55:08 <medos> Windows.
16:55:44 <medos> :D
16:56:34 <EDSGD> windows
16:56:41 <medos> Jaggy webfonts, no helvetica, easy to spot when a mac designer wasn't considering other devices.
16:58:05 * medos doesn't mind really
16:58:16 <medos> I just enjoy pointing out stuff that a mac guy misses.
16:58:18 <medos> ?kocho
16:59:07 <CottonBalls> Nope.
16:59:12 <CottonBalls> You get Arial. 
16:59:33 <CottonBalls> I work at a place that builds PCs, so I guess I am biased.
16:59:40 <CottonBalls> But I like being able to replace things myself.
17:00:06 <CottonBalls> I also just priced out a 27" iMac vs what I could build on Newegg and I saved about $700 and had a more powerful CPU and GPU.
17:03:10 <medos> That advantage evens out considering that an iMac is optimized from start to finish.
17:03:54 <medos> Apple knows what cpu,gpu,hdd will be used, osx can take full advantage of those specs.
17:04:37 <TheWhisper> So why are they still so damn slow?
17:04:57 <medos> bleh
17:04:58 <medos> :p
17:05:05 <medos> i didn't want to defend macs

17:24:21 <TheWhisper> Hi, Shottyb
17:25:22 <shottyb> Hi, TheWhisper :)
17:25:22 <TheWhisper> Student, freelancer, or pro?
17:25:25 <shottyb> freelancer
17:25:32 <medos> neato
17:25:36 <shottyb> I was hoping to get some honest critique on some recent work
17:26:00 <medos> shoot!
17:26:09 <shottyb> It's not by any means complete, but I'm looking for feedback on the general layout
17:26:13 <shottyb> http://72.167.35.81/~absolute/aztest/
17:26:28 <shottyb> The branding and logo's weren't done by me, I just designed the web page
17:26:37 <TheWhisper> Medos, do you think HP has their own custom firmware on this drive?
17:27:35 <TheWhisper> Hm
17:27:37 <TheWhisper> Seems like it
17:28:26 <shottyb> any thoughts, medos?
17:28:55 <medos> hmmhmm, pretty barebones
17:29:29 <CottonBalls> I feel like the black background make the grey feel like it is too empty.
17:29:46 <CottonBalls> Also not a fan of the glowing text.
17:29:56 <CottonBalls> Or the drop shadows.
17:30:00 <medos> it could use some smooth rounded elements
17:30:01 <shottyb> Cool
17:30:02 <medos> not sure where
17:30:08 <TheWhisper> Hm
17:30:31 <medos> but right now it's a box inside a box inside a box inside a box
17:30:31 <CottonBalls> I do like what you are doing with the mouseover images.
17:30:31 <shottyb> the glowing effect- you mean the hover over on the top navigation correct?
17:30:31 <CottonBalls> Yeah.
17:30:31 <TheWhisper> Not bad
17:30:31 <TheWhisper> Yeah, cool mouseovers
17:30:41 <medos> pc screen , browser, your page, your page content, your page images, your page image descriptions
17:30:55 <TheWhisper> I'd make the yellow mouseover on the main image a little more opaque
17:30:55 <medos> all boxes
17:30:55 <CottonBalls> Try doing the same layout but with more subtly colored backgrounds. 
17:31:00 <TheWhisper> And yeah, too much glow on the navigation on hover
17:31:09 <TheWhisper> And the drop shadows
17:31:12 <TheWhisper> lose them
17:31:15 <TheWhisper> You don't need 'em
17:31:17 <CottonBalls> If you must use background textures, try this site.
17:31:18 <CottonBalls> http://subtlepatterns.com/
17:31:20 <shottyb> funny I actually had the effect far more subtle at first but the client requested it to be more prominent
17:31:27 <shottyb> I love that site cotton
17:31:41 <medos> he probably thought the site needed more flashyness
17:31:44 <TheWhisper> Ah, client requests
17:31:45 <CottonBalls> Tell your client it makes the site feel old and they won't want it anymore. 
17:31:49 <TheWhisper> Yup
17:31:50 <TheWhisper> Also
17:31:56 <TheWhisper> yeah
17:31:58 <CottonBalls> Try giving him interesting type maybe.
17:32:10 <CottonBalls> But glows and drop shadows are generally a bad thing.
17:32:16 <shottyb> Any thoughts on a better effect for the roll over than a glow?
17:32:28 <shottyb> 10-4, I really appreciate the advice guys :)
17:33:25 <shottyb> So Cotton, you think the backgrounds could use some lightening up, right?
17:33:55 <CottonBalls> Yeah. Right now they are too stark.

17:33:59 <shottyb> also- any thoughts on this page in particular? http://72.167.35.81/~absolute/aztest/products.html
17:34:13 <shottyb> i played around with it a ton before arriving at that,,, but now it seems like it doesn't really mesh with the rest of the site
17:34:21 <CottonBalls> Too many textures.
17:34:44 <CottonBalls> The background has a texture, the box housing hte content has texture, the box housing the shoe has texture
17:34:51 <shottyb> guilty as charged
17:34:53 <shottyb> :)
17:34:54 <CottonBalls> The shoe image background has texture.
17:35:03 <CottonBalls> Textures are good if used in small doses. 
17:35:06 <CottonBalls> It is like chocolate.
17:35:13 <CottonBalls> A little is ok, but too much and you get fat.
17:35:17 <shottyb> hahaha
17:35:34 <shottyb> drop the individual shoe background texture?
17:36:01 <CottonBalls> http://www.naturalizer.com/en-US/Womens/_/_/Dress+Shoes/_/Products.aspx
17:36:11 <CottonBalls> See how this site has many shoes but it doesn't feel invasive?

17:38:32 <CottonBalls> Give them some room to breathe. 
17:38:56 <CottonBalls> The grid based layout is working well for you so far, just keep it true to that and you will be fine.
17:39:04 <CottonBalls> Also look up a ton of other retailers and see how they do it.
17:39:10 <CottonBalls> Like 50 different people.
17:39:12 <CottonBalls> Not just shoes.
17:39:21 <CottonBalls> To get an idea of how they present materials. 
17:39:35 <shottyb> Great. Thank you very much- you've been extremely helpful :)

18:07:41 <medos> if i point out annoying shit and suggest changes
18:07:46 <medos> and he likes what i throw at him
18:08:01 <medos> that could lead to more than just throwing shit at him
18:08:16 <marshmallow> or it's just free beta testers
18:08:27 <medos> you remember how i don't have a website?
18:08:33 <medos> and freelance anyway?
18:08:41 <medos> those kinda things land me jobs
18:09:37 <marshmallow> hokies

18:09:45 <marshmallow> well, enjoy the free beta testing
18:09:57 <medos> that's calculated
18:09:59 <marshmallow> dunno, it reminded me of all those people who jumped at timeline for facebook
18:10:14 <marshmallow> pretty sure they didn't get paid
18:10:20 <medos> uhhhhhhm
18:10:27 <medos> i wasn't planning to just answer his questions
18:10:40 <medos> rather pick up the topic and swing it in an entirely different direction

20:18:06 <medos> hahahaha

20:18:54 <medos> "that was fun"
20:18:56 <medos> leaves
20:19:03 <marshmallow> hi Mr
20:19:49 <MrLime> Hi marsh
20:21:18 <medos> hey MrLime, what's up?
20:21:41 <marshmallow> watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=rdIWKytq_q4 =D
20:21:53 <MrLime> Trying to get rid of my iPad.
20:22:00 <marshmallow> y?
20:22:11 <MrLime> Because I don't need it anymore.
20:22:51 <medos> Isn't it pretty easy to get rid of ipads on ebay?
20:23:11 <MrLime> I'm selling it on AVForums 
20:23:55 <medos> Probably easier.
20:24:03 <medos> Is it 1st/2nd/3rd generation?
20:24:08 <Whisper> Well, that nap didn't help
20:24:10 <MrLime> 3rd
20:25:01 <MrLime> Once I get rid of that I'll be picking up the new iphone. My current phone is the 3GS and it's falling apart. 
20:25:10 <medos> Oh dear.
20:25:29 <medos> Wait for this one http://i.imgur.com/l09D3.png
20:25:30 <Whisper> So
20:25:39 <Whisper> I'm going to get to design the website for this year's Fall Workshop
20:25:40 <Whisper> http://thefallworkshop.com/
20:25:44 <Whisper> Me and another design student
20:26:09 <Whisper> We're not going to do any coding though (the professor and his friend are gonna do that, as it's supposed to be done by the end of september).
20:26:21 <Whisper> I'm pretty sure I can come up with something better than what's there now ;)
20:26:30 <medos> Buy a psd template.
20:26:32 <medos> :-P
20:26:41 <Whisper> hy
20:26:43 <Whisper> *Why
20:26:45 <Whisper> I wanna design it
20:26:52 <Whisper> We're allowed to have fun with it
20:26:53 <MrLime> Go Go gadget Wordpress :P
20:26:56 <medos> MrLime did you have any actual use for your iPad ever?
20:27:03 <Whisper> The back-end exists already
20:27:09 <Whisper> We don't need to worry about anything
20:27:13 <Whisper> except for the design
20:27:15 <Whisper> that's all I need to do
20:27:19 <Whisper> Pretty nice :p
20:27:29 <medos> Never really found tablets to be useful, personal preference though.
20:27:52 <MrLime> Yeah. I use it every day but I need a phone more than a tablet right now. 
20:29:02 <MrLime> I have a desktop PC and that's about it so I use it for things when I'm out or in another room.
20:29:33 <medos> So many gadgets.
20:29:46 <MrLime> used to have a mbp but that got stolen. 
20:29:49 <medos> < Three laptops and an ipod.
20:29:58 <Whisper> That codrops thing doesn't work in ff ;(
20:30:04 <Whisper> Oh
20:30:07 <Whisper> The perspective one doesn't
20:31:44 <medos> MrLime I'd take it off your hands but iPad buying isn't a priority for me at the moment.
20:32:27 <MrLime> Yeah I understand. I've got some interest from a guy in England so I think I might be posting it away on Monday. 
20:32:46 <medos> RoyalMail!
20:35:35 <marshmallow> [16:29] <medos> < Three laptops and an ipod. <-  WOW!  overkill?
20:35:59 <marshmallow> sorry mr.lime.  I already have an ipad
20:36:02 <medos> Will be four laptops soon.
20:36:05 <medos> :P
20:36:11 <marshmallow> though honestly, if it wasn't free...  I wouldn't have gotten an iPad
20:36:18 <marshmallow> i'm a huge apple hater XD
20:36:23 <marshmallow> jajaja
20:36:43 <marshmallow> i have the iPad 2. 
20:37:19 <marshmallow> [16:36] <medos> Will be four laptops soon.<--damn.  
20:37:35 <marshmallow> i only use 1 laptop
20:37:37 <marshmallow> my other 2 are like ancient.
20:37:54 <marshmallow> (4yrs & 8yrs old)
20:38:05 <marshmallow> oh wait, i lied...  6yrs & 10yrs old

20:40:33 <medos> hey edodes :)
20:41:09 <medos> Welcome, what's up?
20:41:18 <marshmallow> oh
20:41:20 <edodes> just wondering if someone could help me, I seem to have gotten myself in a pickle
20:41:30 <edodes> no design help or anything like that
20:41:31 <edodes> jsut advice
20:41:33 <edodes> just*
20:41:39 <marshmallow> sup?
20:42:26 <edodes> I'm designing a logo for someone and we agreed it'd be $150 (family friend). However, after designing the logo they like, they now want a lot of changes
20:42:40 -!- cubic [42aa88c5@gateway/web/freenode/ip.66.170.136.197] has joined ##reddit-gd
20:42:41 <edodes> it has a face and they have decided it doesn't look enough like them
20:42:48 <edodes> even though it's "cartoony"
20:43:07 <edodes> I've already spent about 20 hours working on it back and forth, and they were happy with it
20:43:22 <MrLime> Have you been paid yet?
20:43:31 <edodes> I would prefer not to change it any more or ask for more, but I've got no idea how to ask for more... without sounding like an ass
20:43:36 <edodes> unfortunately not :(
20:43:49 <marshmallow> should've gotten at least half downpayment XD
20:44:10 <MrLime> did they sign a contract?
20:44:17 <edodes> Heh, well it was more a one-time favor
20:44:21 <edodes> no, jsut e-mails
20:44:22 <edodes> just*
20:44:25 <medos> D:
20:44:34 <edodes> I know, terrible of me
20:44:38 <edodes> I know better too :(
20:45:14 <medos> I don't usually look for clients/work through friends and family, that usually ends bad.
20:45:17 <edodes> They're happy what I've already made, and I'd be fine with the $150, but all these new changes they want are going to make this project not worth it
20:45:43 <MrLime> why not tell them it will cost an extra $50 to make the changes?
20:45:55 <edodes> Yeah, I've been refusing to do any work for 3 years and decided to do one website for a family member (needed the money)
20:45:59 <Azra-el> you meet them in person.. and make some grunting noises and keep pointing to your stomach.. when they dont understand it.. keep grunting like a neanderthalian and extend your palm... and make a slicing motion on your stomach... open your mouth .. point to it then extend your hand
20:46:03 <edodes> and now they're referring people to me
20:46:09 <medos> lol
20:46:20 <edodes> xD
20:46:21 <cubic> "look, guy, I got a guy across town that's willing to pay 200, now I'm sorry, but this is a business"
20:46:38 <Azra-el> still think my idea is bestest
20:46:41 <edodes> Well I feel like an ass, because I said "I charge $150 for a logo"
20:46:45 <medos> make it look worse
20:46:58 <medos> every time they ask for fixes
20:47:00 <medos> herpderp
20:47:03 <edodes> lol
20:47:35 <edodes> The sad part is, all these changes that she wants, won't even be visible
20:47:42 <MrLime> How long will the extra work take you?
20:47:53 <marshmallow> what kind of extra work?
20:48:03 <Azra-el> when i did commercials for clients that were very demanding (stupidly demanding not with reason) .. i would make a montage of the same clip thrice and write Version one version two and version three on each of them.... and ask them to choose because they know best
20:48:19 <edodes> probably 4 hours or less if she doesn't ask for any more changes, but this will be version 10
20:48:25 <cubic> that's brilliant. ahaha
20:48:47 <medos> https://vimeo.com/22053820
20:48:52 <edodes> basically I made a logo with her face on it, cartoony, very simple vector in a style she liked (very exagerated features)
20:49:36 <edodes> she thinks the face shape "doesn't look like her" the "hairline is wrong" "I like a different purple", "my eyes are green-brown, not green"
20:49:51 <Azra-el> always has worked for me. 90%of the time they would say version X and be happy they made the decision.... 10% of the time they would choose version 2 but with the shadow treatment from version one... and i would go.. wow.. that's exactly what i thought.. and send the same video again.... and they would approve it
20:50:00 <edodes> nice
20:50:13 <MrLime> I think you should just grin and bear it. Get the work done. Give her what she wants even though you may not like it. Learn from this experience and next time write up a contract.
20:50:37 <medos> yup
20:50:39 <medos> family friend
20:50:44 <medos> disappointed
20:50:53 <edodes> yeah no kidding

21:10:37 <edodes> do I need to respond to each one saying "yes I got your idea"

21:18:12 <edodes> usually just reply to the ones with questions
21:18:23 <edodes> or reply when I have an update
21:19:20 <medos> doesn't sound like 150 bucks to me
21:19:32 <cubic> sounds more like
21:19:34 <cubic> 150 fucks
21:19:44 <cubic> high five
21:20:21 <cubic> on a more serious note. I've been lurkin'. as long as each question/concern is addressed, you should be fine. 
21:20:45 <cubic> in other words, use phrases like "got your email", "i hear your concern", "regarding..." 
21:21:48 <edodes> Yeah, I jsut wanted to charge less than normal because 1) family friend and 2) crowdspring is minimum $200
21:21:58 <edodes> just* I seriously cannot type that word correctly the first time
21:22:34 <medos> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/icon/awesome.htm
21:22:40 <edodes> usually I'll group the response into one, "here's the latest revisions, got your note about your eyebrows"
21:22:45 <medos> anyone mind adding this page to his/her homescreen
21:22:50 <medos> and check the lookies?

21:31:35 <cubic> hey MrLime, how's that sketchbook pro app? useful?
21:32:07 <MrLime> I've found it handy when taking notes and drawing up ideas when I'm out and about. 
21:32:37 <cubic> i feel ya. i got the demo for the phone, and like any drawing app on a phone, it's pretty useless. except for shits and giggles. 
21:32:45 <Azra-el> 1. drawing.. try Paper 2. notes try penultimate
21:33:34 <cubic> "penultimate is so useful, it's seriously the second to last note taking app i'll need!"
21:33:40 <marshmallow> not all apps are useless
21:33:44 <marshmallow> for drawing
21:34:08 <MrLime> I use paper but I prefer Sketchbook. 
21:34:12 <cubic> I've found the screen to be too small to do anything worthwhile
21:34:30 <marshmallow> http://i.imgur.com/hCkMt.jpg <-- made on an ipad
21:34:34 <marshmallow> bwahaha
21:34:35 <Azra-el> cubic - thats why you dont draw on the phone.. draw on an ipad
21:35:16 <cubic> if i had an iPad, I totally would. 
21:35:20 <MrLime> yeah the iPad is incredibly handy for quick drawing and notes.
21:35:43 <cubic> i bet. 
21:35:49 <cubic> kick some ass in draw something
21:35:49 <medos> http://www.creativeapplications.net/category/ipad/

22:18:57 <Whisper> edodes, do you have a site?
22:19:06 <Whisper> Also, medos, icon looks good on those screenshots.
22:19:21 <Whisper> I still think there's slightly too much detail for the size, but eh.
22:21:07 <medos> imagine a green box in the middle
22:21:22 <Whisper> ?
22:21:27 <Whisper> In the middle of what?
22:22:09 <Whisper> Like http://i.imgur.com/jAHKA.png ?
22:22:17 <Whisper> I wasn't commenting on the yellow. I think the yellow is fine.
22:23:52 <medos> you wanted the box to be green
22:24:16 <Whisper> I know, but I was wrong.
22:24:28 <Whisper> The yellow is good. It just took me a while to get used to it.

23:02:33 <Satz> and i got him chorizo, chillies, rocket, tomatoes & Stilton cheese
23:03:56 <Azra-el> i could work with that
23:04:10 <Satz> grilled chicken on a spinach bed topped with asparagus. with sweet potatoes chips, pineapple chunks in nutella for desert (ye i chickend out)
23:05:32 <Satz> and his dish was fried chorizo + tomatoes, chillies on rocket with stilton and red wine sauce
23:05:43 <Satz> then we spooned tenderly 
23:06:16 <medos> lol
23:06:55 <Azra-el> chicken breast stuffed with spinach with  pineapple salsa on top of deepfried asparagus
23:07:28 <Satz> sounds much more interesting than what i did
23:07:50 <Azra-el> wbat is rocket?
23:07:53 <Satz> i can cook like 4 things really well, and thats it!
23:09:10 <Satz> sry its spelt differently im just so used to saying rocket and also dont pay enough attention to what i type
23:09:21 <Azra-el> is this it? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eruca_sativa
23:09:29 <Satz> its roqroquet
23:09:33 <Satz> haha
23:09:40 <Azra-el> is it rucola?
23:10:05 <Azra-el> yup.. it is... 
23:10:21 <Satz> woops was trying to ggogle spell check it, seriously no clue how to spell it
23:10:52 <Satz> that sounds similar to how its said in italian where its most commonly used
23:12:20 <Satz> ok i'm having a blonde moment, it is spelt rocket........
23:12:47 <Azra-el> so my idea for his ingredients would be panfriend chopped chorizo, scoop out the tomato fill it with with the chopped fried chorizo and chillies ... make a cap out of stilton cheese put all of it in the oven so the cheese melts and seals the tomato.. garnish with rucola pesto
23:14:09 <Satz> you sir are a culinery genius
23:14:29 <Azra-el> me sir are fucking mouth watering at the moment
23:14:37 <Satz> culinary
23:14:53 <Satz> lol
23:15:04 <Azra-el> but dont let it in the oven too much ... the tomato need not be fully cooked
23:15:30 <Azra-el> try it one time ... let me know how it is
23:16:03 <Satz> seriously do you have an keen interest in cooking, or do you just cook everday and posses knowledge that i should have!
23:16:41 <Azra-el> hardly cook once or twice a week .. dont have the time .. but im a culinary enthusiast... molecular gastronomy and all
23:17:24 <Satz> bet you want this then http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/lifestyle/all/01112/facts.modernist_cuisine_the_art_and_science_of_cooking.htm
23:18:05 <Azra-el> made some nice balsamic vinegar spheres with sodium alginate couple of weeks ago
23:18:17 <Azra-el> and yes... im drooling at that book.. but cant really afford it yet
23:18:39 -!- Kocho [~Chris@unaffiliated/kocho] has joined ##reddit-gd
23:20:20 <Azra-el> gimme 5 more ingredients :P
23:20:58 <Satz> you have introduced me to molecular gastronomy, might have know aspects of it before, but not as a field 
23:21:45 <Satz> lol, ok shall i try to make it hard?
23:21:53 <Azra-el> its fun to play with... like this deconstructed soup http://www.moleculargastronomynetwork.com/67-recipes/Reconstructed-Tomato-Soup.html
23:22:29 <Azra-el> choose whatever ingredients you want :)
23:22:37 <medos> D:
23:23:11 <Satz> eggs, fennel, anchovies, bread, onions
23:24:04 <Azra-el> i HATE fennel. lol. 
23:25:01 <Satz> ah roast fennel is so full of flavour, with a good italian cured meat. Mmmmmmm
23:29:46 <Azra-el> hmmm ... wrap the eggs in onion layers...put in ziploc bag leave overnight. lets assume the bread is a baguette. slice it oblique. toast it in the oven. chop the fennel and onion finely, saute them together. boil the egg. cut in half lengthwise and then cut again each half lengthwise plate like this   slice of baguette > anchovies > first sclice of egg > layer of sauted onion/fenel > top 
23:29:46 <Azra-el> of the egg
23:29:54 <Satz> ah that soup is awesome, this style of food makes me think of heston blumenthal
23:30:34 <Azra-el> well if you know heston blumenthal... you might know kitchen chemistry. and if you liked that.. .please look at In search of perfection
23:32:06 <Satz> will do
23:32:49 <Azra-el> so... how did i do
23:33:09 <Satz> finding it harder to visualise it so re reading
23:34:17 <Azra-el> imagine a tower (sic medos) and the layers are slice of baguette > anchovies > first sclice of egg > layer of sauted onion/fenel > top of the egg
23:34:33 <Satz> slice it oblique, not sure what is meant here
23:34:41 <medos> [sic]
23:34:57 <Satz> isnt it a sandwhich?
23:35:32 <Satz> oh top of the egg
23:35:48 <Satz> just read top. assumed bread
23:36:22 <Azra-el> http://i.imgur.com/h3RhN.png
23:37:06 <Satz> ye sounds cool i think you did a good job again, not as good as the 1st two though :p
23:37:09 <Azra-el> and yes... its like a sandwich .. except its between finger food and fullblown sandwich
23:37:48 <Azra-el> well ... no matter.. ill leave you with the egg wrapped in onion ... its the bomb. your boiled/fried egg with have a hint of onion
23:38:11 <Satz> why but the egg in.... as you can see i was just going to ask about that, it was the most interesting part
23:38:17 <Satz> put*
23:39:15 <Azra-el> the egg shell is porous ... and if you wrap it inside an onion .. or bacon.. or something smoked... and put it in a ziploc bag... the flavors pass through the shell inside the uncooked egg
23:39:59 <Satz> interesting, wouldnt have realised that
23:40:12 <Azra-el> bacon flavored eggs... mmm
23:41:10 <Satz> classic combo
23:43:33 <Satz> think ill watch a bit of kitchen chemistry and go sleep. only a minute in and the level of detail he is going into is infatuating 
23:43:41 <Whisper> What the fuck is happening here?
23:43:49 <Whisper> I am so confused >.>
23:44:03 <Azra-el> food talk
23:44:05 <Satz> lol, food+science+games happened

23:47:09 <Kocho> its usually like that
23:47:17 <Kocho> if you have a few busy days, you get a bit flat
23:47:32 <TheWhisper> I guess I'm just not used to doing any work, maybe
23:47:40 <TheWhisper> So it ends up being like 1:1 for me
