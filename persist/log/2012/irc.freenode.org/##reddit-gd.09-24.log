00:09:54 <TheWhisper> hey kocho, edsgd, which size do you like better for the overlay: http://i.imgur.com/dJ2oT.png or http://i.imgur.com/RWCk2.png
00:10:50 <Kocho> overlay of what?
00:10:55 <TheWhisper> the photo
00:11:05 <TheWhisper> I wanted to do it differently, but the profs suggested doing an overlay
00:11:08 <TheWhisper> so we could make the photos bigger
00:11:16 <TheWhisper> instead of having to leave room for text above them
00:32:12 <Kocho> so put simply, the tray area allows for more text?
00:32:43 <EDSGD> be back in a bit.
00:33:15 <TheWhisper> yes, kocho
00:33:34 <TheWhisper> I realized though that I depends more on the text size I need
00:33:41 <TheWhisper> so I'm tryina work that out
00:33:46 <Kocho> yeah
00:33:47 <EDSGD> hmm I don't remember typing that
00:33:50 <Kocho> depends on the size and volume
00:34:06 <EDSGD> Why not show us something with content.
00:34:09 <TheWhisper> yup
00:34:20 <TheWhisper> The annoying thing is I don't have a tablet
00:34:27 <TheWhisper> so I don't know what certain sizes look like on them
00:34:39 <TheWhisper> I was told 14-16 pt for body
00:34:42 <TheWhisper> but idk
00:36:19 <TheWhisper> I'm also working at double resolution
00:36:25 <TheWhisper> so I have to double all my sizes 
00:36:27 <TheWhisper> which is annoying lol
00:37:19 <Kocho> do it in illustrator
00:37:23 <Kocho> problem solved
00:38:25 <TheWhisper> Well, not really
00:38:31 <TheWhisper> Plus they wanted a PSD
00:38:41 <TheWhisper> and I don't have 1000 hours to do it in illy and then port it
00:38:55 <TheWhisper> I should learn Fireworks lol
00:50:29 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/OXM95.jpg kocho edsgd
00:50:30 <TheWhisper> lol
00:50:58 <Kocho> it takes up too much of the photo
00:51:11 <Kocho> it should probably be landscape too
00:52:10 <TheWhisper> It's hideable
00:52:18 <TheWhisper> Probably should have said that first lol
00:52:23 <TheWhisper> It shows up automatically on the first photo
00:52:24 <TheWhisper> with a 
00:53:03 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/4oEVK.jpg type of thing
00:53:17 <TheWhisper> and then for the rest of the photos, it's hidden unless you choose to show it
00:55:26 <Kocho> still think it should be on the bottom
00:56:52 <TheWhisper> I don't like it on the bottom
00:56:59 <TheWhisper> Line lengths end up being super long
00:57:16 <TheWhisper> oh wait
00:57:18 <TheWhisper> I'm dumb
00:57:24 <TheWhisper> I was putting story description text
00:57:27 <TheWhisper> in where the caption should be
00:57:29 <TheWhisper> fail
01:03:56 <TheWhisper> ugh

02:08:50 <TheWhisper> it probably would have
02:09:06 <EDSGD> Oh shit.
02:09:27 <EDSGD> Just found out the person who hired me as a freelancer is the person who did this awesome.

02:14:37 <EDSGD> CTRL+S all the way.
02:17:28 <TheWhisper> More like CTRL+SHIFT+S
02:17:53 <TheWhisper> It didn't even crash though
02:17:55 <TheWhisper> I was just an idiot
02:18:00 <TheWhisper> I accidentally took a screenshot
02:18:06 <TheWhisper> which opened paint
02:18:11 <TheWhisper> so I hit alt+f4 to close paint
02:18:20 <TheWhisper> but for some reason, it had tabbed back to ps
02:18:29 <TheWhisper> so when the "are you sure you want to close" window popped up
02:18:32 <TheWhisper> it was PSes
02:18:32 <EDSGD> swift fingers
02:18:40 <TheWhisper> but I thought it was paint's
02:18:53 <TheWhisper> so I hit the Esc key before it even loaded

02:34:36 <TheWhisper> *vertical grid
02:37:33 <TheWhisper> Hm
02:37:36 <TheWhisper> I think it was 14
02:41:56 <zkamca> Now I've seen the entire Season 2 of Sherlock there's nothing left to occupy me :(
02:47:22 <EDSGD> You're talking about the UK one? zkamca
02:47:29 <zkamca> Yes
02:48:02 <TheWhisper> Such a good show
02:49:41 <TheWhisper> i'm really pissed that I can't figure out this vertical grid I had
02:52:18 <zkamca> As in can't decipher or remember it?
02:52:58 <TheWhisper> Can't rememeber
02:52:59 <TheWhisper> See above
02:53:04 <TheWhisper> I accidentally closed my PSD
02:53:32 <TheWhisper> I think it was 14 or 16 columns vertically
02:53:36 <TheWhisper> but it's not working right
02:53:40 <TheWhisper> it doesn't line up properly
02:56:22 <TheWhisper> why the fuck
02:56:25 <TheWhisper> will this not line up
02:56:56 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/5mrrE.jpg
02:57:00 <TheWhisper> The bottom lines up, but the top won't
02:57:14 <zkamca> Ha
02:57:20 <zkamca> Is that at 100%?
02:57:31 <TheWhisper> uh
02:57:43 <TheWhisper> no
02:57:44 <zkamca> Also whats the current distance between lines?
02:57:56 <zkamca> Its probably a photoshop illusion then
02:58:09 <zkamca> If you zoom to 100% you'l see an accurate representation
02:58:32 <TheWhisper> No
02:58:33 <TheWhisper> It's not
02:58:38 <TheWhisper> I've been zooming in and out lol
02:58:46 <TheWhisper> and
02:58:57 <zkamca> Hm
02:59:01 <TheWhisper> 110 px
03:00:05 <zkamca> Is there anyone lurking here who knows about .htaccess redirects? My damn file keeps shoving me to an absolute path instead of relative

04:25:55 <TheWhisper> I do not like pixels
04:25:59 <TheWhisper> They are doing impossible things right now
04:26:06 <TheWhisper> And I cannot figure it out
04:26:26 <zkamca> Pagination finished
04:26:28 <zkamca> Heck yes
04:30:26 <zkamca> http://i.imgur.com/sSP7q.png
04:30:29 <zkamca> Just figured I'd share
04:32:18 <TheWhisper> Nice, zkamca, but the gap between the 18 and 19 is large
04:33:29 <zkamca> ...
04:33:37 <zkamca> This isn't designed yet yo
04:34:00 <zkamca> If you saw the code you'd see it's not even competently coded yet. This version is more of a "fuck it it just needs to work"
04:34:17 <TheWhisper> Oh lol
04:35:01 <zkamca> But now that this is done I can work on splitting the page up into digestible blocks that are included and clean up the code
04:35:11 <zkamca> V1 should hopefully be up by next weekend
04:48:03 <TheWhisper> okay
04:48:07 <TheWhisper> this is what I've redone so far http://i.imgur.com/Fe50w.jpg
04:48:11 <TheWhisper> it's still not right though
04:48:20 <TheWhisper> the grid just doesn't fit
04:56:51 <TheWhisper> okay
04:56:58 <TheWhisper> After spending two hours redoing what I originally had

06:13:40 <Kocho> nup
06:13:58 <medos> that's probably because i made it up
06:14:03 <medos> but
06:14:08 <medos> look at cereal packaging
06:14:16 <medos> there's always at least two strokes and a gradient
06:14:23 <medos> or two strokes and a drop shadow
06:14:33 <medos> or two strokes and a bevel & emboss
06:14:42 <medos> for eye-catchy packaging

06:15:24 <medos> http://bargainbriana.com/wp-content/uploads/Crispix.jpg
06:16:13 <Kocho> thats a good point
06:16:17 <Kocho> mine looks a bit flat
06:16:22 <medos> yup
06:16:38 <medos> now imagine that getting printed
06:16:44 <medos> no matter how glossy the packaging
06:16:50 <medos> it'll not really convey depth
06:17:06 <medos> without a cheesy gradient/bevel&emboss/dropshadow
06:18:32 <Kocho> kk
06:18:35 <Kocho> thanks
06:18:43 <Kocho> of you think i should draw a shadow for the bin?
06:20:09 <medos> copy the entire bin
06:20:14 <medos> pathfinder merge
06:20:20 <medos> and add a superfat stroke?
06:20:35 <medos> or offset path either way
06:23:39 <medos> is dribbble 90% russians nowadays?
06:23:40 <medos> lol
06:24:45 <medos> Kocho i would try to add some vague-floor resembling shape

06:25:26 <Kocho> yeah its looking better

06:26:44 <Kocho> i think i've stuffed the bin though

06:30:29 <medos> esp. for print
06:31:05 <Kocho> thats very true
06:31:20 <Kocho> you look at wrappers/food packaging and its usually always corny effects
06:31:24 <Kocho> that actually look good
06:31:36 <medos> yeah
06:31:39 <medos> uhhhm
06:31:44 <medos> dublicate the bin buddy text layer
06:31:56 <medos> remove all strokes and effects, just make it white
06:32:06 <medos> then offset path -10 or -20 or whatever
06:32:22 <medos> then expand appearance and remove stuff
06:34:51 <medos> -> http://i.imgur.com/VCW2j.png
06:34:54 <medos> this basically
06:35:06 <medos> example might not be the best
06:35:11 <medos> but that should add some pop
06:35:13 <Kocho> understood
06:35:40 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Qoss5.png
06:35:46 <medos> lower opacity on the white shit
06:36:58 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/WgBHL.png
06:37:01 <medos> hoooray
06:37:16 <Kocho> gradient stroke looks pretty good too
06:38:23 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/FOhiK.png
06:38:25 <medos> yeah
06:38:38 <medos> i wouldn't make your drop shadow that bluntly black
06:39:51 <medos> if at all it should beee
06:40:14 <Kocho> yeah its a bit harsh
06:40:20 <Kocho> ill make it like a mid green
06:40:37 <medos> it suggests that the word is 3d right now
06:40:44 <medos> which it is not
06:40:53 <medos> so it either needs some manual shading (white stuff i just explained)
06:40:55 <medos> or gradient
06:41:24 <medos> or two inner glows (one center blur amount +30 or more, one edge blur amount below 10)
06:42:02 <medos> the best way would be starting indesign and looking which effects are available there
06:42:12 <medos> those usually work for print :P
06:45:13 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/HP1ef.png <- newspaper-advertising level of effectery
06:46:30 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/bb6.png
06:46:44 <medos> perspective is off
06:46:55 <medos> binbuddy goes top left light
06:47:13 <medos> ugh
06:47:15 <medos> hard to explain
06:47:18 <Kocho> oh
06:47:25 <medos> like
06:47:28 <medos> the bin itself is tilted
06:47:28 <Kocho> i think the text and bin have similar shadows
06:47:33 <Kocho> so it looks flat
06:47:43 <Kocho> and then the bb text has a drop shadow downwards
06:47:43 <medos> and bin buddy is straight up perspective
06:47:50 <medos> make the outer stroke a little smaller
06:47:57 <Kocho> on bb?
06:48:01 <Kocho> on the bin*
06:48:09 <medos> text
06:48:32 <medos> also: pleeeease put the stroke on the outside
06:48:40 <medos> below the megastroke
06:48:47 <medos> appearance panel
06:48:52 <medos> top to bottom
06:48:59 <medos> superfat stroke -> smaller stroke
06:49:04 <medos> and make it set to outer stroke
06:49:33 <medos> i think only one of those two is possible
06:50:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/lHwpG.png <- this is throwing me off
06:50:38 <Kocho> the white gradient to 0
06:50:44 <Kocho> or the big green stroke?/
06:52:23 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/hbntu.png
06:52:29 <medos> the perspective being random
06:53:05 <medos> bin buddy is even level with perspective but the shadows/bevel make it appear to be tilted in a weird manner
06:53:14 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/bb7.png
06:54:17 <Kocho> oh yeppp
06:54:38 <medos> better
06:54:38 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/RV8pU.png
06:54:46 <medos> ^ this is what i meant about the stroke
06:55:00 <medos> not sure what you did but it looked a little off
06:55:16 <medos> my pic being the prefered way
06:55:31 <medos> to make it not look off
06:55:50 <Kocho> oh - giving it the look of no perspective?
06:55:53 <medos> dark green fat outline needs to be thinner
06:56:06 <medos> i'm talking about two problems i see at once right now D:
06:56:10 <medos> might make it confusing
06:56:31 <medos> 1. the fat green stroke and the stroke of the fat green stroke look wrong and 2. the perspective (looked) wrong
06:57:46 <medos> 3. the bin buddy text doesnt stand out
06:57:52 <medos> for 3. http://i.imgur.com/lVjKq.png
06:58:32 <medos> -> http://i.imgur.com/EYVGA.png
06:59:01 <medos> -> http://i.imgur.com/nicpK.png
06:59:06 <medos> do i make any kind of sense? :P
07:01:35 <Kocho> yeah
07:01:38 <Kocho> i understand
07:01:47 <Kocho> client is running out of time though
07:01:48 <Kocho> lol
07:02:01 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/NWIiC.png
07:02:03 <medos> aight
07:02:20 <Kocho> i think ill leave it like that
07:02:24 <medos> already loooks lotso better
07:02:28 <Kocho> and tell 'em i need a bit more time
07:02:29 <medos> in a few simple steps
07:02:35 <Kocho> yeah very true
07:02:43 <Kocho> thanks :)
07:02:54 <Kocho> thanks mr.kelloggs
07:03:07 <medos> 2 strokes and an effect yo
07:03:12 <medos> that's the cereal rule
07:03:18 <medos> if the cereal rules is not obeyed
07:03:22 <medos> it does not look like cereal
07:05:35 <medos> yo Kocho make the shadow of the footpedal thingie
07:05:37 <medos> lower opacity
07:05:48 <medos> and feather or blur via appearance panel
07:05:51 <medos> a little bit
07:06:01 <Kocho> kk
07:06:25 <medos> euh
07:06:27 <medos> actually
07:06:53 <medos> maybe put it below the foot-kicking thing
07:07:51 <Kocho> yeah
07:07:58 <Kocho> it should be because of the lighting
07:08:00 <Kocho> brain fade there

09:17:08 <medos> Sat
09:17:16 <medos> topic for challenge #6
09:17:23 <medos> thearrowflies did you make a golfer shoop?
09:42:49 <Sat> you want some ideas medos?
09:42:55 <medos> yeah
09:42:59 <medos> well not some
09:43:02 <medos> a good one
09:43:04 <medos> precise one
09:43:13 <Sat> sure
09:44:24 <medos> or two good ones
09:44:29 <medos> remember that this has to go on the blog
09:44:48 <medos> and must look consistent
09:45:01 <medos> e.g.: rebrand a famous company
09:45:25 <medos> would be faar to vague as someone might do a toy, box, logo or just photoshoop a store sign
09:50:29 <Sat> how about "create a motivational poster for an ER department" :o
09:52:00 <medos> .gis hang in there cat
09:53:05 <zkamca> Awww yeeeh son
09:53:14 <Sat> if kitty gives up in ER kitty's dead
09:53:31 <zkamca> I should put the database on fuelnanny.com already so I can update it and be a show off/have you all break it
09:53:42 <zkamca> But I am lazy as hell
09:54:59 <medos> as long as you're not on level "too lazy to tell people i'm lazy" level
09:55:08 <medos> it's not too bad
09:56:13 <zkamca> Setting the bar high I see
09:56:41 <medos> i always expect people to be horrible
09:56:52 <medos> makes me appreciate any normal behaviour a lot more
09:56:54 <medos> :P
09:57:46 <medos> "oh just lazy? better than being a serial killer"
09:58:50 <zkamca> I'm happy to have the github guy installed, makes commits crazy easy. Plus it helps me by giving easy access to giant chunks of code I accidentally deleted between commits
09:59:03 <zkamca> Really need to sleep though,. work tomorrow
09:59:30 <medos> napnanny
10:02:02 <Sat> or "front cover for new magazine (insert name here), the client requests use of signautre colour X and must include picture of X person (celebrity whatever)
10:05:29 <Sat> or "create a visual identiy for an emotion" :o
10:07:18 <medos> that's pretty vague
10:07:22 <medos> not for me
10:07:37 <medos> but i'm trying to pick something that does not entice 20000 questions each day from TheWhisper
10:07:43 <medos> just to have him end up not doing it
10:07:53 <medos> choose something simple ;)
10:08:30 <Sat> hmm
10:09:19 <medos> tl;dr: try to pick something without using variables or untangible ideas
10:09:31 <medos> *intangible
10:10:20 <Sat> apart from design to most people here have some other noteable shared interests?
10:10:28 <Sat> do most*
10:11:13 <medos> i guess games would be a common factor
10:11:22 <medos> ?whisper
10:11:39 <Sat> good good

10:11:57 <medos> and a thing where quite a bit could be improved is typography
10:12:06 <medos> for a few guys
10:16:04 <Sat> i like the idea of creating an add for a new video game magazine of some sort
10:16:29 <medos> tl;dr: try to pick something without using variables or untangible ideas
10:16:43 <Sat> some new e-magazine, add would be full page ipad add apeearing in some other publication
10:17:20 <medos> tl;dr: try to pick something without using variables or untangible ideas
10:17:23 <medos> D:
10:18:03 <Sat> well you can remove many variables with a simple breif
10:18:32 <medos> should fit in one sentence
10:20:32 <medos> the challenge should be something that 1. does not warrant questions for guys who participate
10:20:51 <medos> 2. should be doable for people with less knowledge about design theory
10:21:19 <Sat> 3. fun 
10:21:26 <medos> yup
10:21:57 <Sat> how about just a logo for said new publication?
10:25:16 <medos> what new publication of some sort ?
10:26:35 <medos> my goal was to have you give a specific recommendation, i say awwwww yea
10:26:44 <medos> then ask two more people in here if it's good
10:26:48 <medos> and then put it in the topic
10:27:03 <medos> the last time we were vague about the challenge we ended up photoshopping a boxxy wallpaper
10:27:08 <Sat> was just trying to get an idea if i was heading in the right direction
10:27:28 <medos> right direction would be your direction ;)
10:28:14 <Sat> i pander to the whims of others :(
10:30:36 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/pl2W2.png
10:31:38 <medos> challenge should be fun and easy to grasp and do
10:32:04 <medos> just think of something and if 2-3 people in here like it (doesn't even need to be my kind of thing)
10:32:16 <medos> it's on
10:32:48 <medos> the more complicated the challenge the less likely it is that people want to participate
10:38:39 <medos> CPUUUUUUUUUU
10:39:14 <Sat> "Fatter is Phatter" - campaign.  Create a poster/add promoting the benifits of being fat. focus on 1 aspect/idea
10:39:14 <medos> wtf
10:41:11 <Sat> for too long people have focused on the negatives of being fat, Healthy living propoganda surrounds us everywhere
10:41:22 <Sat> Its time to see the positivies

15:56:03 <internetpolice> like beer belly
15:56:06 <internetpolice> headbobbing
15:56:09 <internetpolice> now
15:56:09 <TheWhisper> Yup
15:56:33 <internetpolice> did you ask me for a tutorial that makes you master anatomy human figure drawing master?
15:56:39 <TheWhisper> Nope
15:56:42 <internetpolice> why?
15:56:45 <TheWhisper> As that wasn't the purpose
15:56:46 <R0tt3n> do you guys make your own ornaments in illustrator? Or do you have sites for free vector ornaments?
15:56:59 <internetpolice> but you want to get better at draaaaaawing
15:57:01 <marshmallow> zakmac, well, I mean...  everwhere seems to be $4.12 / gal
15:57:01 <internetpolice> what do you do
15:57:16 <R0tt3n> what do i do?
15:57:17 <TheWhisper> Practice
15:57:21 <TheWhisper> Obviously
15:57:38 <zakmac> I'll be tying into a gas price API sometime this week, marshmallow 
15:57:54 <internetpolice> ok
15:58:02 <internetpolice> now if you can't pick 2 matching colors
15:58:03 <zakmac> Also Yelp for hotels/restaurants/entertainment and Yahoo for weather (at your dest)
15:58:08 <internetpolice> what do you doooooooooooooo?
15:58:14 <marshmallow> hokay
15:58:59 <R0tt3n> uhh a little bit of both
15:59:08 <TheWhisper> uh
15:59:10 <TheWhisper> practice?
15:59:17 <internetpolice> YAAAAAY
15:59:20 <internetpolice> good idea
15:59:23 <TheWhisper> lol
15:59:24 <internetpolice> i would do that if i were you
15:59:38 <internetpolice> R0tt3n www.dinpattern.com
15:59:39 <internetpolice> ?psd
16:00:06 <R0tt3n> oh man thats embarrassing, you werent talking to me ahah
16:00:55 <TheWhisper> lol
16:00:57 <TheWhisper> haha
16:01:40 <internetpolice> R0tt3n it would probably better to make your own
16:01:48 <internetpolice> eh
16:01:56 <internetpolice> well learn how to make your own and use dinpatterns for now
16:03:01 <R0tt3n> yeah ive started making some, heres one that ive made http://i.imgur.com/YBYqj.png
16:03:11 <TheWhisper> Ooh
16:03:15 <TheWhisper> Very art deco-y
16:03:17 <TheWhisper> I like
16:03:35 <internetpolice> that's illustrator right?
16:03:51 <R0tt3n> yeah i want to mix some art deco with my rough typography style
16:03:55 <R0tt3n> i think it would look good
16:04:00 <R0tt3n> and yeha
16:04:07 <R0tt3n> that was done in illustrator
16:04:46 <internetpolice> 1. set colorspace to rgb
16:04:51 <internetpolice> 2. align objects to pixel grid
16:04:57 <Sat> cool, varying the line thickness might be interesting aswell
16:06:13 <R0tt3n> oh fuck you're right one side is thicker than the other
16:06:16 <R0tt3n> god damn it
16:06:19 <marshmallow> btw..  zakmac ...  gasbuddy.com has avg cost of gas for certain places.  Also, your site is missing tolls costs
16:06:26 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/tq9pR.png
16:06:41 <internetpolice> @ R0tt3n
16:07:32 <R0tt3n> where is the colourspace option under/
16:07:37 <internetpolice> if it aint sittin' on a pixel it be blurryin'
16:07:51 <zakmac> Oh man, toll costs
16:07:53 <internetpolice> File -> Document Color Mode
16:07:54 <zakmac> Poop
16:08:01 <zakmac> All these things I didn't think of
16:08:07 <TheWhisper> Btw, internetpolice, quick question. When you're measuring things, do you measure from http://i.imgur.com/Cys8f.png (i.e. the antialiased pixel or the non-AA one)?
16:08:46 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/lyTXo.png
16:08:54 <internetpolice> that's my main measurement device
16:09:04 <TheWhisper> Yeah
16:09:06 <TheWhisper> but
16:09:08 <internetpolice> but
16:09:11 <TheWhisper> Like for his thing
16:09:14 <TheWhisper> in order to measure it
16:09:20 <TheWhisper> You have to use the ruler
16:09:21 <TheWhisper> no?
16:09:25 <internetpolice> no?
16:09:38 <TheWhisper> How did you measure it then?
16:09:56 <internetpolice> i didn't measure anything
16:10:12 <internetpolice> i just saw that his shapes in .ai are off-pixel
16:10:13 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/uHZBx.png
16:10:21 <TheWhisper> oh
16:10:22 <TheWhisper> okay
16:10:30 <TheWhisper> so say you are measuring something from a jpg or png
16:10:35 <TheWhisper> and you have aliasing on edges
16:10:39 <internetpolice> oh
16:10:40 <TheWhisper> which would you measure from
16:12:11 <internetpolice> i would rather take the envelope
16:12:14 <internetpolice> and 100 bucks
16:12:22 <internetpolice> if that's ok with you
16:12:54 <internetpolice> http://www.maa.org/devlin/devlin_0708_04.html
16:13:37 <TheWhisper> ...
16:13:54 <TheWhisper> I'd say it doesn't matter which you measure from, as long as you're consistent in that
16:14:02 <internetpolice> lol
16:14:22 <TheWhisper> But then you run into the problem of what if you're measuring one pixel larger or smaller
16:14:31 <TheWhisper> regardless of consistency
16:15:13 <internetpolice> true
16:15:24 <internetpolice> that's why i take the envelope
16:17:13 <internetpolice> R0tt3n your blacks were cmyk black, change those too, make sure that you change your palette from basic cmyk to basic rgb
16:17:25 <internetpolice> or you'll always have 33 / 33 / 33 RGB blacks
16:18:33 <R0tt3n> I see, I'm use to setting up stuff in photoshop, so I'm clueless when it comes to standard illustrator practices 
16:18:50 <R0tt3n> thanks for letting me know :D
16:18:58 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/Qe2Ag.png
16:19:33 <internetpolice> maybe the dark grey was intentional :P
16:19:52 <R0tt3n> nah it wanst ahha
16:20:00 <R0tt3n> so what will this align to pixel grid do?
16:20:32 <internetpolice> .g bjango pixel hinting
16:20:45 <R0tt3n> cause when i make a new object it doesnt "snap" i guess you'd call it to the grid
16:20:50 <internetpolice> http://bjango.com/articles/pixelpasting/
16:20:59 <internetpolice> that article doesn't talk about illustrator
16:21:03 <internetpolice> but it's the same thing
16:21:17 <internetpolice> in .ai you go view -> snap to pixel
16:21:18 <internetpolice> and
16:22:20 <R0tt3n> mine only has snap to grid/point
16:22:42 <internetpolice> point
16:22:45 <internetpolice> should do the same
16:23:12 <internetpolice> Pixel is only visible if you turn on pixel preview
16:24:47 <R0tt3n> i se i see
16:25:55 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/ly5QQ.png
16:27:29 <marshmallow> mildly interesting: celebrities photos with bikes badly photoshopped out of them http://imgur.com/a/z449L
16:27:35 <R0tt3n> so do you leave the pixel preview on all the time?
16:28:31 <internetpolice> i have mouse hotkeys with modifiers
16:28:36 <Sat> you can scale strokes in illustrator... damn i've wasted so much time in the past
16:29:03 <internetpolice> Sat maybe read the illustrator manual next? :P
16:29:23 <TheWhisper> oooh internetpolice, good idea. i should set one of my keys to ctrl+;
16:29:26 <Sat> pfft i dont read books ;)
16:30:04 <internetpolice> well then waste lots of time reinventing the wheel!
16:30:07 <internetpolice> R0tt3n http://i.imgur.com/VqyqM.png
16:30:23 <TheWhisper> <internetpolice> well then waste lots of time reinventing the wheel!
16:30:51 <internetpolice> i hold down (7) and left/right clicking gives me outline / pixel preview
16:31:05 <TheWhisper> Oh
16:31:06 <TheWhisper> Nice
16:31:09 <TheWhisper> That's a cool feature
16:31:09 <internetpolice> (10) / (11) in this case
16:31:45 <TheWhisper> Do you have separate photoshop/illy/etc profiles?
16:32:05 <internetpolice> nay, i just change the hotkeys for each program
16:32:33 <TheWhisper> oh
16:32:35 <TheWhisper> I'm blind lol
16:32:38 <TheWhisper> Profile slot
16:33:14 <R0tt3n> internetpolice, get this mouse and never touch hotkeys again: http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga
16:33:45 <internetpolice> i would touch all of them at once
16:33:47 <internetpolice> as a leftie

16:35:50 <TheWhisper> ?
16:35:57 <internetpolice> ?
16:36:02 <internetpolice> that's undo right there
16:36:03 <TheWhisper> I was setting the keys on my mouse
16:36:05 <TheWhisper> I know
16:36:05 <internetpolice> better than undo
16:36:15 <TheWhisper> And was wondering why they differentiated between undo and multiple undo
16:36:25 <TheWhisper> And that gives an interesting answer from one of the guys involved in the feature

16:36:39 <internetpolice> who airbrush

16:38:16 <internetpolice> how nice they phrased it in that article
16:38:18 <internetpolice> =D
16:44:15 <TheWhisper> hm
16:44:27 <TheWhisper> I have step forward/step backward hotkeys
16:44:32 <TheWhisper> and show/hide guides
16:44:36 <TheWhisper> and fit to window
16:44:39 <marshmallow> i just use the shortcut =/
16:44:39 <TheWhisper> any other suggestions
16:45:37 <internetpolice> i would recommend "pick matching color" on mouse button four
16:45:47 <internetpolice> and "apply matching color" on mouse button five
16:47:17 <TheWhisper> Is that a thing?
16:49:22 <internetpolice> yup
16:49:34 <TheWhisper> What's the hotkey?
16:50:55 <internetpolice> i
16:51:05 <internetpolice> and b
16:51:22 <TheWhisper> oh lol
16:51:59 <TheWhisper> Speaking of, I wonder if there's a way to make the ruler the default for I
16:52:01 <TheWhisper> instead of eyedropper
16:52:33 <internetpolice> shift + I?
16:52:48 <TheWhisper> nice
16:53:18 <TheWhisper> I'm gonna make a mouse shortcut for it too
16:53:30 <internetpolice> why?
16:53:38 <internetpolice> you going to rule photoshop?
16:53:45 <TheWhisper> yes
16:55:19 <internetpolice> i would make a shortcut for i
16:55:23 <internetpolice> then hold shift
16:55:31 <internetpolice> or not shift
16:55:40 <internetpolice> when hitting that shortcut
16:55:44 <TheWhisper> I just made it n

19:32:47 <medos> marshmallow !
19:33:16 <medos> i need a quick demographic input
19:33:16 <marshmallow> hokies
19:33:16 <medos> from a lady
19:33:16 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/FpH1A.png
19:33:16 <medos> ^ does this style appeal to you
19:33:26 <marshmallow> eh, not really
19:34:02 <medos> now i have run out of questions
19:34:24 <marshmallow> but for what?
19:34:24 <medos> essentially it's about making an advertising vector video
19:34:24 <medos> with characters maybe
19:34:24 <marshmallow> i mean, it's alright
19:34:24 <marshmallow> but nothing like ZOMG YES
19:34:52 <medos> just wondering if that style would ring with fashion-knowledgeable middle-upper-class gals
19:35:50 <medos> because that video is supposed to appeal to ladies like that
19:36:25 <marshmallow> oh
19:36:51 <marshmallow> i'm pretty much unfased by fashion commercials
19:37:02 <marshmallow> like, if you asked me right now, I couldn't tell you which one touched me the best
19:37:06 <medos> hm
19:37:14 <marshmallow> *unphased
19:38:07 <medos> you know enough about fashion to see if shoes are too big
19:38:52 <medos> so i guess your answer still counts ;)
19:38:58 <marshmallow> oh wait!  I know which one is my favorite fashion commercial
19:39:02 <medos> show me
19:39:06 <medos> or tell me

19:40:26 <marshmallow> sorry, yea..  doesn't help your cause
19:40:26 <marshmallow> lol
19:40:27 <medos> guy in underwear = hooray
19:41:04 <medos> well my cause is: if you'd watch a video with two people chatting and those characters looked like that, would you be able to identify & connect with them
19:41:10 <medos> which is a very specific question i guess
19:42:24 <marshmallow> hmrrr...
19:42:32 <marshmallow> in terms of fashion?
19:43:05 <marshmallow> eh, idk
19:43:18 <marshmallow> i would prefer to see... you know..  people with the clothes
19:43:27 <marshmallow> are you selling the clothes?
19:43:32 <marshmallow> then vectorized clothes
19:43:45 * marshmallow is confused
19:44:17 <medos> full explanation: this is a video which is supposed to advertise a product, the video is supposed to be narrated by a girl and the video itself is first person
19:44:30 <medos> and the video will show characters and scenes
19:44:53 <medos> and i'm wondering if that style would be interesting enough for girls to watch it
19:44:57 <marshmallow> or is this like another app?
19:45:37 <medos> it's a startup thingie
19:45:54 <medos> about clothing shopping
19:46:12 <medos> idk
19:46:19 <medos> do trendy girls go to websites and watch videos?

19:46:56 <marshmallow> umm
19:47:10 <marshmallow> I personally hardly go to webbies and watch videos
19:47:14 <medos> aye
19:47:20 <marshmallow> but that's also cause ads don't phase me
19:47:22 <medos> do your gals on fb post any videos?
19:47:24 <medos> like
19:47:28 <medos> advertisement videos
19:47:30 <medos> share them?
19:47:44 <marshmallow> erm, depends i guess
19:48:20 <marshmallow> on the video
19:48:34 <medos> i guess the beckham ad got reposted quite frequently then
19:48:43 <medos> lol
19:48:51 <marshmallow> lol
19:49:07 <marshmallow> i mean, very rarely do my friends post video ads
19:49:24 <marshmallow> I'm more likely to get the ad of "so and so Liked Target.  Want to Like Target?"
19:49:46 <marshmallow> the last video ad I personally posted was the Samsung bashing Apple ad
19:49:52 <medos> lol
19:49:54 <marshmallow> cause I <3 samsung and hate apple =D
19:50:12 <marshmallow> I had another friend repost that too
19:50:16 * marshmallow shrugs
19:50:23 <medos> woooooo
19:50:26 <medos> +1
19:50:29 <medos> upvote
19:50:33 <medos> like
19:50:41 <medos> thumbs up
19:51:28 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4kMphNNtBE <- it's supposed to be like this but with a girly setting
19:51:30 <medos> and a bit simpler
19:52:28 <medos> i'll probably need to figure out if girls watch those videos at all
19:52:31 <medos> or videos like that
19:52:31 <medos> hm
19:53:44 <marshmallow> oh, hmr...  yea, I've seen commercials like that
19:54:45 <medos> on your facebook feed?
19:55:10 <marshmallow> mmm..  no, on tv

19:56:41 <marshmallow> yo
19:57:01 <marshmallow> erm, on my facebook feed...  no I haven't seen those types of commercials
19:57:02 <marshmallow> I've seen them on TV
19:57:14 <marshmallow> it really depends on the connection/product
19:57:14 <medos> ahh
19:57:19 <medos> yeah
19:57:27 <marshmallow> though, I wouldn't worry about it too much.
19:57:38 <medos> i'm just trying to find something that would make that video worth watching for girls
19:57:38 <marshmallow> National average is like 2% for clickthrough rates
19:57:41 <medos> i'm not a girl
19:57:49 <marshmallow> hawt guys
19:57:51 <medos> so i need to find something that would hook
19:57:53 <medos> girls
19:57:59 <medos> like beckham underwear
19:58:05 <medos> D:
19:58:05 <marshmallow> lol
19:58:17 <marshmallow> i mean, I personally like a lot of dance ads too
19:58:25 <marshmallow> cause I recognize certain dancers that I <3 <3 <3
19:58:49 <marshmallow> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cob84Sg8aQ4 <-- like this one
19:59:03 <marshmallow> it's from 2009, but I still remember it
19:59:13 <marshmallow> mostly cause there's a bboy..  his name is Cloud...  he's in it.
19:59:59 <marshmallow> idk, if you wanna see what ads are American's favorite ads...  just google "Superbowl ads"
20:00:16 <medos> GLEE
20:00:19 <medos> AWESOME
20:00:22 <medos> totally forgot about it
20:00:26 <medos> good stuff
20:00:29 <medos> thank you
20:00:30 <marshmallow> those are the ones we sit and watch ads
20:00:32 <marshmallow> =D
20:00:58 <medos> style of clothing?
20:01:07 <medos> that video is 2009 is that stuff still in/fashionable?
20:01:58 <marshmallow> erm, I don't shop at GAP
20:02:01 <marshmallow> not my style XD
20:02:15 <medos> lol
20:02:35 <marshmallow> idk, I don't really watch ads to determine which store I shop at
20:02:37 <medos> well, you've been a huuuuuuuuuge help
20:02:46 <marshmallow> there's already a stigma of what type of stores are what quality
20:02:46 <medos> already
20:02:51 <medos> yeah
20:03:11 <medos> i'm mostly inquiring to dodge bullets
20:03:17 <marshmallow> lol, hokies
20:03:23 <medos> making a checklist of: nononono this would never work
20:03:45 <medos> and so far you've been the biggest help in making that list ;)
20:03:46 <marshmallow> idk if there's may superbowl clothing ads....  I know there's a lot of car / bud / cheetos commericals
20:03:54 <marshmallow> woot!
20:03:57 <marshmallow> *there's many
20:04:18 <medos> yup
20:04:23 <medos> what's on your workdesk right now? :P
20:04:29 <medos> personal question is personal
20:04:32 <medos> but just wondering
20:04:40 <marshmallow> hmr...
20:04:48 <marshmallow> a few notepads
20:04:57 <marshmallow> a few stacks of papers
20:05:07 <marshmallow> bunch of napkins/pens
20:05:15 <marshmallow> laptop + monitor
20:05:28 <medos> you sound like you're actively lifting stuff to look for buried things
20:05:29 <medos> haha
20:05:29 <marshmallow> i got a second keyboard too; idk why.  I never use it
20:05:37 <marshmallow> lol, nope
20:05:45 <marshmallow> and a giant water bottle
20:05:52 <marshmallow> and some bowls 
20:05:53 <medos> no starbucks ?
20:06:01 <marshmallow> nah
20:06:09 <marshmallow> i already threw away my coffee cup
20:06:19 <marshmallow> starbucks is for really BAD days I barely can stay awake
20:06:33 <marshmallow> like, the bad days where I really shouldn't be driving since I nearly fall asleep at the wheel
20:06:34 <marshmallow> those days
20:06:49 <medos> i thought you looooove starbucks D:
20:06:50 <marshmallow> oh, and my purse.  that's taking up a good amount of space.  har har
20:06:59 <medos> PURSE
20:07:02 <marshmallow> yea, but we have free coffee at work
20:07:04 <medos> oh christ
20:07:19 <medos> girls are very particular about their purses
20:07:31 <marshmallow> yea... I got a lot
20:07:42 <marshmallow> >_<;;
20:07:44 <medos> lol
20:07:49 <marshmallow> but, I use them to their fullest!
20:07:54 <marshmallow> till they break =D
20:08:00 <marshmallow> though, some never break.  yayyyy!
20:08:02 <medos> let's hope they do so at home
20:08:22 <medos> (the breaking thing)
20:08:23 <medos> :P
20:08:25 <marshmallow> chyea
20:08:46 <marshmallow> why ya wanna know what's on my workdesk?
20:08:49 <marshmallow> =p
20:08:54 <medos> that was for the video
20:08:57 <medos> office scene
20:09:02 <medos> girl at her desk
20:09:06 <medos> what's on the desk?
20:09:22 <marshmallow> oh
20:09:26 <medos> :P
20:09:38 <medos> sorry for tricking you into market research questions
20:09:46 <marshmallow> you can just put like...  computer, jar full of pens/highlighers/pencils, lamp, and a few photos
20:09:52 <marshmallow> dones
20:09:53 <medos> it's called medosturking
20:09:58 <marshmallow> gah
20:10:09 <medos> nah
20:10:16 <medos> to be honest i didn't consider the handbag thing
20:10:19 <medos> or purse rather
20:10:24 <medos> which is an awesome piece of info to have
20:10:26 <marshmallow> oh.  lol
20:10:54 <marshmallow> oooh, and my phone!
20:10:55 <marshmallow> hahaha, I forgot about that
20:11:00 <marshmallow> I never use it.  that's why XD
20:11:07 <medos> lol
20:11:09 <medos> oh
20:11:11 <medos> actual phone
20:11:15 <medos> not smartphone
20:11:21 <marshmallow> yea, like for conference calls
20:11:49 <marshmallow> but it's a pretty standard for a desk to have one
20:11:56 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Ut0CV.jpg
20:12:01 <medos> i hope it looks like this
20:12:18 <marshmallow> lol, no
20:12:50 <marshmallow> http://www.oit.uci.edu/images/7960G%20Large.jpg like this
20:14:33 <medos> euuuuugh
20:14:36 <medos> that looks so
20:14:39 <medos> office like
20:14:40 <medos> lol
20:15:11 <marshmallow> lol, pretty standard
20:15:16 <marshmallow> my old job had one just like it
20:16:19 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/ek4w1.jpg <- my old job
20:16:29 <medos> we had a phone like that
20:16:48 <medos> we = 6 designer guys had one phone
20:16:53 <medos> wheeee
20:16:53 <marshmallow> oh really?
20:16:56 <medos> yeah
20:16:58 <marshmallow> that's like my home phone line
20:16:59 <marshmallow> lol
20:17:03 <marshmallow> not business-y at all
20:17:14 <medos> it was a bigger room though
20:17:17 <medos> no cubicles
20:17:27 <medos> glass door and partially even glass walls
20:17:37 <medos> people could see what i am doing through half the building ;(
20:17:58 <medos> so one phone was enough, we could just hand it to the next guy
20:18:27 <marshmallow> gotchya
20:18:41 <medos> anyway
20:18:52 <marshmallow> http://www.jackgeorges.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/p/a/patent_collection_p3604.jpg <-- somewhat close to my purse 
20:19:37 <medos> i think black would be the most common kind of purse ?
20:19:45 <marshmallow> yar
20:19:56 <medos> so least likely to make girls go "ewwww"
20:20:03 <medos> would be a black purse
20:20:05 <medos> stylish one
20:21:06 <marshmallow> yup
20:21:22 <marshmallow> or you could have it match the girl's outfit
20:21:24 <marshmallow> that's also okay
20:21:54 <marshmallow> I personally don't like moving my wallet from purse to purse...  so I don't match outfit with purse.  thus, I get a black purse
20:22:16 <medos> ninja purse
20:22:19 <medos> goes with everything
20:23:25 <marshmallow> yup!

20:27:12 <edodes> medos you awake?
20:27:19 <edodes> hi everyone
20:27:21 <medos> hi
20:27:47 <edodes> ever dealt with a client on Adderall?
20:28:33 <medos> it's not that easy to get prescription drugs in Germany so i never had any adderall to try
20:28:38 <edodes> heh
20:29:02 <medos> if the client is on adderall
20:29:08 <medos> i would wonder why you know that he is on adderall
20:29:20 <edodes> Because he's my by-marriage, uncle
20:29:30 <medos> so he's not a client
20:29:36 <edodes> he was hyper focused on getting his website done for about a week
20:29:43 <edodes> and now he's super focused on something else
20:29:50 <edodes> so I haven't heard from him in a few weeks
20:30:02 <edodes> driving me nuts not getting any feedback
20:30:10 <medos> lol
20:30:19 <medos> you will never be happy will you?
20:30:23 <edodes> never :)
20:30:24 <medos> client is nagging
20:30:29 <medos> client is not saying stuff
20:30:44 <edodes> I'm just afraid he's going to hyper focus on the website again in a week and I'll have nothing to show him since I haven't heard from him xD
20:31:10 <edodes> yep, don't know how you deal with it lol
20:31:52 <medos> by being annoyingly precise
20:31:55 <medos> :p
20:31:59 <edodes> haha
20:33:19 <marshmallow> woah!  medos...  is there a way on minus.com to see where your views are coming from?  My hidden characters album got 20+K views!
20:33:30 <medos> D:
20:34:23 <marshmallow> 26,000+
20:34:30 <marshmallow> i'm like, wtf?!
20:34:40 <medos> well
20:34:43 <medos> every time
20:34:47 <medos> i thumbs up something
20:34:48 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/eqLqu.png
20:35:00 <medos> 88 followers will see that when they open minus
20:35:02 <medos> :p
20:35:11 <medos> not saying i'm the only reason but
20:35:13 <medos> it works like that
20:35:20 <medos> i follow people who have shittons of followers
20:35:26 <medos> so if they see that
20:35:29 <marshmallow> OOOooh!  I didn't know that
20:35:30 <medos> they'll thumbs it up
20:35:39 <medos> it's like a ponzi scheme
20:35:40 <medos> in good
20:35:47 <marshmallow> i needa thumbs up more stuff!
20:36:44 <medos> 1. upload stuff
20:36:52 <medos> 2., follow people who upload cool stuff
20:37:14 <edodes> so... what's the point? exposure?
20:38:00 <marshmallow> oh, idk
20:38:02 <marshmallow> i guess?
20:38:32 <marshmallow> I just uploaded some work cause it was cool to show and imgur is blocked
20:38:40 <edodes> ah
20:38:59 <medos> edodes it's fun knowing that 26k people looked at something you made and got enjoyment out of it ;)
20:39:05 <medos> that's a major drive for me
20:39:15 <edodes> hmm that makes sense
20:39:22 <edodes> that's why I used to like deviantart
20:41:14 <medos> yeah
20:41:37 <edodes> looks like pinterest
20:41:44 <medos> yeah
20:41:47 <medos> with awesome imagery
20:41:58 <edodes> defintiely
20:41:58 <marshmallow> pretty cool =D
20:42:00 <medos> people upload stuff (that they did not make themselves mostly)
20:42:09 <medos> and if you throw your own shit in the mix
20:42:14 <medos> and people like your shit
20:42:17 <marshmallow> still doesn't beat my highest (132,836) views 
20:42:20 <medos> between high class awesome pics
20:42:28 <medos> it's neat validation
20:42:31 <medos> no circlejerking
20:42:48 <medos> just gut-reaction thumbs up yaaaay
20:42:49 <medos> ;)
20:42:57 <edodes> :D
20:44:57 <marshmallow> lol, now I'm wishing I did a better job on them
20:45:02 <marshmallow> they're very sloppy one-shots
20:45:09 <marshmallow> but I guess people like guessing
20:45:13 <medos> haha
20:45:13 <edodes> change woody
20:45:20 <edodes> if that's what we're talking about
20:45:21 <edodes> xD
20:45:29 <medos> i only thumbs up'd the ones i liked
20:45:55 <medos> then i didn't look at minus for a week
20:46:23 <marshmallow> yea, I didn't look at it for a while
20:47:43 <medos> still time to fix 'em :p
20:47:45 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/BQ8H3.jpg
20:47:48 <marshmallow> i guess people just like guessing
20:48:10 <marshmallow> eh, nbd
20:48:22 <marshmallow> I knew which ones were the better and which ones were worse when uploading
20:48:47 <marshmallow> lol
20:48:49 <marshmallow> the ones you liked were the ones I made towards the end
20:49:34 <marshmallow> sonic got the most likes
20:49:35 <marshmallow> lol
20:51:08 <marshmallow> hermione & jack sparrow (yea, they are pretty bad) got the least.
20:51:35 <medos> i liked your best ones
20:51:45 <medos> people who follow me liked the best ones out of the ones i liked
20:52:16 <medos> the people who follow my followers liked the best ones out of the ones my followers liked
20:52:23 <medos> but you had some followers before, right?
20:53:06 <marshmallow> yea, not many
20:53:19 <marshmallow> i should probably like other people's stuff
20:53:21 <Sat> 26,000 views nice
20:53:26 <marshmallow> more likely to get more followers that way
20:53:59 <medos> don't worry about it
20:54:05 <medos> just thumbs up stuff you like
20:54:14 <medos> if you even use the site for pic browsing
20:54:16 <medos> http://champ-ooh.minus.com/muCmRzAcm
20:54:21 <medos> yaaaay 60k
20:55:27 <medos> edodes everything that you perceive as annoying and preventable request after finishing a design piece
20:55:44 <medos> should be noted on your "annoy client with it before starting work" list
20:55:49 <edodes> haha
20:56:13 <edodes> well I just got done reading the "10 types of clients" or something a few days ago
20:56:20 <edodes> probably why I'm noticing it more xD
20:58:04 <edodes> which would you choose $1000 check or $1500 flatscreen
20:58:16 <marshmallow> $1000 check 
20:58:32 <medos> a client that does not ask such a question
20:58:43 <edodes> lol
20:58:45 <marshmallow> reason: we have 9 tvs.  I really don't think a 10th is necessary
20:59:20 <marshmallow> note: not all tvs are hooked w/cable thus a lot of em are just chilling and hogging space
20:59:31 <edodes> I just hate the feeling that I'm taking money, even though I've earned it, so I figured getting "gifted" a flatscreen that we want would be better
20:59:33 <medos> reason: i would have a gb connection server, several domains, a custom made suit but no way to buy stuff i want if i agreed to offers like that
20:59:58 <Sat> Everywhere expect the USA http://i.imgur.com/YlEbz.png
21:00:08 <edodes> well it's family, I'd never even consider from anyone else
21:00:35 <edodes> sat: really? called wally?
21:00:42 <Sat> hell ye
21:00:47 <edodes> crazy
21:00:51 <Sat> i loved wally
21:02:15 <medos> ok ttyl
21:02:15 <medos> gotta doo moar stuff
21:02:15 <medos> edodes are you guessing your unclient is on adderall or do you know he is?
21:02:15 <medos> if you're guessing: stop doing that
21:02:34 <edodes> I know he is
21:02:48 <edodes> his wife told me haha

21:03:06 <edodes> I called her asking if he was getting my e-mails/calls after it'd been 2 weeks
21:03:28 <medos> bad info
21:03:35 <medos> bad bad info
21:04:01 <edodes> ?
21:04:20 <medos> will you expect him to act normal at all?
21:04:57 <medos> if he goes hyperfocus on you you'll moan because his drugs drive him
21:05:08 <medos> :P
21:05:43 <medos> i'm just saying: try to forget his adderall stuff unless he tells you personally
21:07:33 <medos> adderall amplifies behaviour, he's still just your uncle
21:07:35 <medos> adderall or not
21:07:36 <medos> ;)
21:10:15 <edodes> ah
21:10:39 <edodes> so suggestions for dealing with the inevitable "are you finished yet" when he finally gets back to me?
21:10:56 <edodes> jsut not mention the lack of contact for weeks?
21:10:59 <edodes> just*
21:11:01 <medos> lol
21:11:13 <medos> confuse him
21:11:26 <medos> then you hit up up, down down, left right left right b a b a
21:11:31 <edodes> lol
21:11:34 <medos> and land a fatality
21:11:38 <edodes> I said suggestions not cheats!
21:13:04 <medos> a walkthrough would be worse than cheating wouldn't it? :P
21:13:13 <medos> have infinity tries
21:13:17 <medos> vs knowing the solution
21:13:31 <edodes> hmm true
21:14:12 <medos> let's say you don't need the konami code
21:14:18 <edodes> although I really want a walkthrough for myst
21:14:19 <medos> because you have infinity clients
21:14:43 <edodes> I don't know if that's a blessing or a curse
21:14:45 <medos> the better you get at getting clients the better you get at dealing with stuff like that
21:14:51 <edodes> right
21:15:04 <medos> :P
21:15:26 <medos> i fail 9 times out of 10
21:15:28 <medos> so don't worry
21:16:00 <edodes> yeah I figure i shouldn't worry since it'll get done eventually :D
21:16:39 <marshmallow>  <medos> then you hit up up, down down, left right left right b a b a <- BACON!
21:16:45 <edodes> wooo
21:16:50 <edodes> sizzle
21:22:44 <medos> .u upvote

23:01:37 <TheWhisper>  Medos, why would I render it as clay?
23:01:42 <TheWhisper> When 1) it's not even done
23:01:47 <TheWhisper> and 2) it's not going to be made of clay
23:03:03 <TheWhisper> and 3) this fucking took me 6 and a half horus to make :(
23:03:08 <TheWhisper> *hours
23:06:01 <medos> just too used to this i guess http://i.imgur.com/6XwK8.png
23:07:04 <medos> it's just a button for me
23:07:07 <medos> clay y/n?
23:07:10 <medos> i say y
23:07:21 <medos> it renders smooth clay-y
23:07:36 <TheWhisper> Too bad I can't use blender :(
23:11:05 <medos> bsurfaces and you'd be done in 5 minutes
23:16:14 <medos> .y bsurfaces
23:18:02 <TheWhisper> I can't decide if Blender is actually easier
23:18:06 <TheWhisper> or if it just looks easier
23:20:00 <medos> big advantage with blender: opensource linux nerd driven
23:20:10 <medos> they make tutorials and addons and figure out shit
23:20:14 <TheWhisper> yeah
23:20:22 <TheWhisper> okay I need to eat dinner
23:20:38 <TheWhisper> Damn
23:20:43 <TheWhisper> I totally hyperfocused in on that
23:20:52 <TheWhisper> oh well brb

23:50:41 <TheWhisper> but I think most people will have 3D printers within 5 years
23:51:00 <Whisper> wtf
23:51:31 <Whisper> oh
23:52:41 <medos> wtf would i do with a 3d printer?
23:55:15 <Whisper>  Anything you want
23:55:22 <medos> a 3d printer?
23:55:35 <Whisper> Print out the perfect lefty mouse
23:55:38 <Whisper> lol
23:55:52 <medos> if you buy a 3d printer
23:55:56 <Whisper> you know
23:55:58 <medos> print a 3d printer and send it over
23:55:59 <Whisper> If i ran a sex toy shop
23:56:04 <Whisper> I would buy one of these
23:56:15 <Whisper> and market it as like "DESIGN AND PRINT YOUR OWN DILDOS!"
23:57:15 <medos> yo
23:57:28 <medos> what would you do in 5 years then?
23:57:49 <medos> business ruined
