05:06:21 <TheWhisper> they're a disgusting organization
05:06:30 <EDSGD> I've never been to wal-mart
05:06:32 <TheWhisper> why the fuck do they have to be the target :(
05:06:44 <TheWhisper> I'd rather it be like Costco or something
05:06:47 <TheWhisper> I've met the ceo of costco
05:06:49 <TheWhisper> he's a nice dude

05:42:06 <EDSGD> That's true.
05:42:45 <EDSGD> TheWhisper are you going to migrate to MySpace?
05:44:31 <TheWhisper> no
05:44:40 <TheWhisper> i'm not a big fan of social media
05:44:48 <TheWhisper> i rarely post much to facebook compared to how much i used to
05:44:54 <TheWhisper> and really only use it to actually communicate
05:45:28 <EDSGD> I'm on the same boat (-) the facebook.
05:45:42 <EDSGD> Goodnight. I'm going to sleep now.
05:46:10 <EDSGD> Post updates on your FallWorkshop the day after tomorrow. ok. :)

13:36:57 <EDSGD> seriously though?
13:37:07 <EDSGD> are you serious?
13:37:20 <internetpolice> i would
13:37:46 <internetpolice> partake in this endeavour
13:37:59 <internetpolice> if there's a usable template for such a site
13:39:08 <EDSGD> How difficult would it be to replicate a tumblr theme?
13:39:21 <internetpolice> not hard i think
13:39:36 <internetpolice> the problem is having a database and management system behind this
13:39:55 <internetpolice> like: something that manages logins yadayada
13:40:09 <internetpolice> just making it a tumblr with domain would be derp
13:40:12 <internetpolice> :P

16:46:34 <marshmallow> oh hai, I can
16:46:35 <marshmallow> yay!

16:58:43 <marshmallow> lol
16:58:50 <marshmallow> i wanna learn how to make them
16:58:58 <marshmallow> apparently there's good money in them O_o
17:00:56 <medos> that's somewhat relative
17:01:42 <medos> there's good money in them when you have business sense, coding skills and design knowledge
17:02:01 <medos> there's no money in them when you just want to make them because a guy on reddit earned 6k last month :P
17:06:09 <marshmallow> =p
17:06:26 <medos> tl;dr: you were the one who told me making something for the money
17:06:29 <medos> is horrible
17:06:34 <medos> D:
17:06:39 <marshmallow> but.. this is 6K/month
17:06:52 <marshmallow> actually, it's also can help me pick up a new skill
17:06:58 <medos> lol
17:07:00 <marshmallow> and get a different/higher paying job
17:07:26 <marshmallow> more for the latter really
17:07:42 <marshmallow> a LOT of businesses uses wordpress
17:07:56 * medos hides
17:08:33 <marshmallow> =/
17:09:03 <medos> selling wp themes
17:09:10 <medos> and selling hand gesture vectors
17:09:13 <medos> ain't that different
17:09:14 <medos> :P
17:09:46 <marshmallow> http://en.wordpress.com/notable-users/ <- learning wordpress can let me work for these ppl =D
17:09:54 <marshmallow> long run dude.  long run.
17:12:47 <medos> going from design to front end webdev is indeed a long-term decision
17:13:18 <marshmallow> well, it can't hurt to try and learn it
17:14:05 <marshmallow> not gonna lie, seeing the salaries of graphic designers kinda capping out at... 65K?  70K? is kinda sad.
17:14:15 <marshmallow> seems like you need more skills to go higher
17:14:26 <marshmallow> which i'm willing to learn now while my brain is semi-functional
17:14:28 <medos> :P
17:14:40 <marshmallow> unless of course if you freelance
17:14:49 <medos> people who browse reddit tend to spend less time doing stuff
17:14:52 <marshmallow> but I rather not have freelance be my personal choice.
17:14:54 <medos> *creating stuff
17:15:01 <medos> so less average income obviously
17:15:16 <marshmallow> not necessarily.  depends on your profession
17:15:26 <medos> true
17:15:34 <marshmallow> there's plenty of engineers on reddit.  =p
17:15:40 <medos> true
17:15:49 <medos> lol
17:16:02 <medos> sounds like you're actively looking for those
17:16:34 <medos> you also just got your first wordpress theme project
17:17:16 <medos> edsgd and i want to start a site called ccccat.com
17:17:20 <medos> it's going to be like http://ffffound.com/

21:09:20 <TheWhisper> got a question

21:20:27 <zakmac> What up TheWhisper 
21:21:01 <TheWhisper> shit 
21:21:05 <TheWhisper> i somehow made my ps grayscale
21:21:23 <TheWhisper> sec
21:21:49 <TheWhisper> Oh I hit a hotkey that hid my channels
21:21:58 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/2nde5.png
21:21:59 <zakmac> Ah
21:22:15 <TheWhisper> anyway, http://i.imgur.com/dpuBc.jpg
21:22:22 <TheWhisper> I still am having trouble with the colors
21:22:31 <zakmac> Jesus man
21:22:38 <TheWhisper> :(
21:22:52 <TheWhisper> Maybe my eyes are broken
21:22:56 <zakmac> That's the color of an orderly's scrubs

21:27:05 <zakmac> Super quick suggestions
21:27:17 <TheWhisper> Hm
21:27:18 <zakmac> Made without caring/a brain
21:27:22 <TheWhisper> Oh so I can use grey 
21:27:24 <TheWhisper> okay then
21:27:50 <zakmac> Of course you can
21:28:10 <zakmac> It's not so much about colors(it is, don't listen to me) as the ratios and how you use them
21:28:40 <TheWhisper> lol
21:29:26 <zakmac> I happen to like green and orange http://i.imgur.com/VU6sz.png
21:29:34 <zakmac> Doesn't make it a good combo though :-\
21:29:46 <TheWhisper> lol
21:29:52 <zakmac> I also like pink/blue. Plus its breast cancer month
21:29:58 <TheWhisper> Hm
21:31:26 <zakmac> Scrapped the FuelNanny design I had going. I've been checking those "get inspired because your brain sucks bags of dicks at design and you know it" sites and felt horrible looking at my work afterward
21:31:48 <TheWhisper> lol
21:33:43 -!- Carson_ [~carson@enat-152010252114.appstate.edu] has joined ##reddit-gd
21:33:55 <zakmac> But then I also feel like "Okay well I scrapped this because their design is awesome but now I have nothing and can't use /this/ as inspiration because I'll straight-up lift it"
21:33:59 <medos> go for this
21:34:24 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/ejzWH.png
21:34:30 <zakmac> So slow with the links
21:35:15 <zakmac> Colloquy does suck with customizations. Searching, too. If someone mentions me hours earlier its impossible to find where
21:35:16 <TheWhisper> fucking colors

22:07:25 <TheWhisper> so after I have something like: http://i.imgur.com/BKeiL.png

22:07:48 <TheWhisper> like no saturations/tints/shades/etc besides those/
22:07:49 <TheWhisper> ?
22:09:15 <TheWhisper> But I can still use grays?

22:15:08 <marshmallow> buh bye =D
22:17:44 <TheWhisper> Are the colors I've used (grey & yellow) bad, or is it the /way/ in which I've used them bad?
22:18:05 <TheWhisper> Cuz I'm trying to use different colors instead, but they don't look right
22:24:05 <zakmac> These .gifs
22:24:10 <zakmac> My eyeballs will fall out

22:38:57 <zakmac> There, now just direct clients to this to begin landing mad work
22:40:12 <zakmac> It makes me motion sick. I hope you're happy
22:40:18 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/lMxcU.jpg better?
22:40:29 <TheWhisper> otherwise i have no fucking clue
22:40:30 <zakmac> Yes
22:40:32 <TheWhisper> what color is
22:40:37 <TheWhisper> really?
22:40:37 <zakmac> But match your orange and yellow
22:40:51 <TheWhisper> um
22:40:54 <TheWhisper> they're the same color
22:40:58 <TheWhisper> just different shades or w.e
22:41:02 <zakmac> Not match, but bring them into the same temperature
22:41:27 <TheWhisper> hm
22:41:37 <TheWhisper> you just mean less difference between them?
22:41:50 <zakmac> No, they can be different
22:42:00 <zakmac> But I'm seeing a shade of yellow and a shade of orange
22:42:08 <TheWhisper> can you circle what you mean?
22:42:08 <zakmac> Needs to be 2 yellow or 2 orange (methinks)
22:42:11 <zakmac> Ya
22:46:35 <zakmac> Imgur, y u no upload
22:47:11 <zakmac> (o_o)Y Y
22:47:37 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/fdkO6.png
22:49:07 <TheWhisper> what
22:49:14 <TheWhisper> yeah but like /which/ ones are those
22:49:34 <zakmac> Que?
22:49:47 <zakmac> Sorry, "¿Que?"
22:49:47 <TheWhisper> like
22:49:56 <TheWhisper> I meant circle them on the screenshot
22:50:01 <TheWhisper> so I knew which ones you were talking about :p
22:50:19 <zakmac> There are 4 colors on the SS, 2 are grey. I don't know you that well, but you can deduce
22:50:34 <TheWhisper> lol
22:51:14 <TheWhisper> okay so you essentially mean 
22:51:14 <zakmac> Also for the ||| in the upper left. Perhaps not a darker/more vibrant orange. Maybe try something darker but more muted?
22:51:44 <TheWhisper> Make them the same color?
22:51:52 <TheWhisper> for the two colors you circled
22:53:43 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/Zlm4V.png
22:53:57 <zakmac> Looking at that - just disregard me
22:54:10 <TheWhisper> lol
22:54:13 <zakmac> This is the colorblind leading the blind
22:55:09 <zakmac> I do like your orange and the grey feels close (maybe the dark grey could use a hint of blue? Very slight) but the top feels off and the ||| might benefit from some further thought also
22:55:33 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/zIZa9.png looks better?
22:56:03 <TheWhisper> *.
22:56:05 <TheWhisper> not ?
22:56:06 <TheWhisper> :P
22:56:10 <adding_confusion> brighter, more neon-y goodness
22:56:41 <TheWhisper> easy: http://i.imgur.com/S3tfV.png lol
22:56:42 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/eh001.png
22:56:46 <adding_confusion> i like it over the last one.. the top peach color was thorwing me off
22:57:31 <TheWhisper> um
22:57:42 <zakmac> Relevant name is relevant
22:57:42 <TheWhisper> zakmac there's nothing in that screenshot you sent that's different?
22:57:53 <zakmac> Man you are bad with color
22:58:00 <zakmac> Eyedrop those greys my man
22:58:07 <zakmac> VERY diff
22:58:13 <TheWhisper> oh
22:58:17 <TheWhisper> I wasn't looking at the grey lol

23:00:09 <TheWhisper> Lol, I was thinking about going there
23:00:11 <TheWhisper> but didn't wanna
23:00:49 <zakmac> I can't let you do that, Dave
23:01:03 * zakmac look at me referencing movies I've never seen
23:02:46 <TheWhisper> lol
23:05:21 <TheWhisper> hm
23:05:27 <TheWhisper> maybe I just shouldn't have a top nav bar
23:06:51 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/16Bp9.jpg vs http://i.imgur.com/Qcn2Y.jpg
23:07:18 <TheWhisper> It feels much more free without one
23:10:32 <zakmac> What is the context?
23:10:38 <TheWhisper> ?
23:10:42 <zakmac> Is that the entire browser window?
23:11:08 <TheWhisper> yes
23:11:28 <TheWhisper> The only thing I lose from the top bar
23:11:29 <TheWhisper> is the logo
23:11:29 <zakmac> Mk
23:11:32 <TheWhisper> which I can move
23:11:52 <zakmac> Right on

23:15:11 <zakmac> "Weighted" to the left

23:29:32 <TheWhisper> hm
23:30:52 <TheWhisper> I mean
23:30:57 <zakmac> So Rza is directing The Man With Iron Fists
23:30:59 <TheWhisper> I can also move the shelf back to the top
23:31:04 <TheWhisper> like
23:32:45 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/EHBLe.jpg
23:32:49 <TheWhisper> that doesn't seem bad
23:33:04 <TheWhisper> but then according to medos it won't be good on the tablet
23:41:36 <TheWhisper> oh cool i have money in my bank account
23:41:37 <TheWhisper> dinner time
23:41:57 <TheWhisper> zakmac do you have an ipad?
23:43:25 <medos> lelele
23:43:38 <medos> loving that jpg
23:43:45 <TheWhisper> Seriously?
23:44:22 <TheWhisper> I know everything is off center in it btw lol
23:45:05 <medos> yeah
23:45:08 <zakmac> No, iPhone 4 only
23:45:11 <medos> literally everything
23:45:24 <TheWhisper> Lol
23:45:34 <TheWhisper> So you do like it though? 
23:49:27 <TheWhisper> Or was that yeah directed toward the 'everything is off center'
23:49:52 <medos> it was a jab at you uploading highres images to imgur
23:50:01 <medos> which results in blurry jpg mud
23:50:04 <TheWhisper> It wasn't a high res image
23:51:23 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/EHBLe.jpg
23:52:01 <TheWhisper> not high res lol
23:52:46 <medos> your logo is blurry

23:57:51 <zakmac> No
23:58:09 <TheWhisper> k
23:58:10 <TheWhisper> :)
23:59:03 <zakmac> TheWhisper: Just start with a blank canvas and fill it in with what you remember from this design
23:59:09 <zakmac> Without referencing it
23:59:14 <TheWhisper> ?
23:59:15 <TheWhisper> why
23:59:31 <zakmac> Then you'll only include the bits you liked without accidentally using the bits that don't work and trying to make it jive
23:59:41 <TheWhisper> Hm
