00:10:28 <Kocho> sort of like that
00:10:37 <medos> + custom strokes
00:10:57 <Kocho> make a custom stroke?
00:11:16 <medos> imgur wont work and it's killing meeeeee
00:11:57 <Kocho> http://www.vectordiary.com/tips-and-tricks/draw-laurel-wreath-vector/
00:12:00 <Kocho> like that?
00:12:54 <medos> y
00:13:25 <medos> http://snag.gy/WvmDC.jpg
00:13:35 <Kocho> rgr
00:13:37 <Kocho> thanks
00:15:33 <medos> http://snag.gy/6UpsD.jpg
00:15:36 <medos> pattern brush
00:16:07 <medos> or blend
00:16:08 <medos> or
00:16:22 <medos> circles and a circle with fill on top in the center
00:16:24 <medos> or
00:16:43 <medos> rotating once and copy then plenty of ctrl/cmd+d
00:16:46 <medos> then mirror
00:16:52 <medos> something along those lines
00:17:12 <medos> ?psd
00:17:18 <medos> or somewhere in there :p
00:18:40 <Kocho> yeah i could use the eps which you gave me
00:18:50 <Kocho> from shutter stock, but wanted to make my own
00:20:49 <medos> check default brushes
00:21:01 <medos> decorative curls or something
00:21:02 <medos> folder
00:22:11 <medos> best method: right click that dribbble shot
00:22:15 <medos> copy image
00:22:19 <medos> open ai
00:22:21 <medos> paste
00:22:24 <medos> livetrace
00:25:08 <Kocho> yep i got it
00:25:11 <Kocho> thanks :)
00:27:04 <medos> comedy option
00:28:29 <medos> use an ornament font
00:28:33 <medos> and type on a path
00:28:36 <medos> path being circle
00:28:59 <Kocho> lol
00:29:00 <Kocho> yeah
00:29:16 <Kocho> that would be side splitting
00:29:32 <Kocho> errâ€¦ any idea why the gap? http://i.imgur.com/c2XM5.png
00:29:54 <Kocho> oh i think i know
00:30:03 <Kocho> because it sets a bounding box around it all
00:30:50 <Kocho> eg: http://i.imgur.com/O0bui.png
00:31:43 <medos> draw empty circle
00:31:49 <medos> add anchor points
00:31:56 <medos> delete top three anchor points
00:32:00 <medos> and cut bottom anchor point
00:32:08 <medos> then make a pattern brush

00:38:22 <Kocho> grr
00:38:32 <Kocho> can't stop making it look like a circular saw blade
00:38:34 <Kocho> lol
00:43:53 <medos> http://snag.gy/6KfWK.jpg
00:44:30 <medos> aint that hard
00:47:59 <medos> to delete images on that site
00:48:00 <medos> lol

00:51:21 <medos> selling
00:52:28 <medos> http://jumpshare.com/b/x7jT8I
00:53:46 <Kocho> are you going to medos? ;)
00:56:12 <medos> i'm a bit worried, if sawblade crests become popular i'd be fucked
00:56:40 <Kocho> ;)
00:56:46 <Kocho> i can understand your worry
00:57:07 <Kocho> how nice is this: http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/37223/screenshots/303477/vb.jpg
00:57:49 <medos> two shadow halftones look off
00:57:54 <medos> bottom right wrinkle one
00:58:47 <medos> just a halftoned rectangular box
00:58:56 <medos> does not relate to the curve above it
00:58:57 <medos> :p
01:04:04 <Kocho> yeah i thought it was crap too
01:04:05 <Kocho> lol
01:27:36 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%2012.27.03%20PM.png
01:27:40 <Kocho> thats terrible isn't it
01:27:41 <Kocho> ugh
01:28:26 <medos> it's not bad
01:28:39 <medos> i'm wondering why you did not use my floral thingie
01:28:42 <medos> .ai file
01:28:54 <Kocho> its for a place which does weddings though
01:28:54 <medos> www.jumpshare.com/b/x7jT8I
01:28:57 <Kocho> so it's a bit off
01:29:05 <medos> mh
01:29:19 <medos> the ribbon is too bold
01:29:22 <medos> and in general
01:29:39 <medos> i think more zapfino style ornaments than a bold ring like that
01:29:44 <medos> when i think wedding
01:29:53 <medos> gut reaction though
01:30:10 <medos> it looks good, consistent and usable
01:30:16 <Kocho> they rent their place out for weddings*
01:30:21 <medos> k
01:30:33 <Kocho> yeah it's a bit bold isn't it
01:31:14 <Kocho> it looks a bit better without the stuff on the banner https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%2012.30.46%20PM.png
01:31:44 <Kocho> hrmm, and i think my font choice probably aint great
01:31:58 <Kocho> needs to be more zapfino style too ;)
01:32:20 <Kocho> the ring pattern is inspired by an image they gave me and all the leaves went in the same direction
01:33:08 <medos> http://jumpshare.com/v/Q7PDMO
01:33:53 <medos> hm
01:34:14 <medos> i have an actual soft woven ribbon vector here but that one was/is for my brother's band
01:34:20 <medos> so all i can serve with is that one
01:34:26 <medos> which does not look wedding tbh :p
01:35:21 <medos> zapfino style just because right now
01:35:27 <medos> at that size it's ok
01:35:29 <Kocho> :D
01:35:39 <medos> but at bigger huge sizes it would probably look bland
01:36:15 <medos> faux shape dragged shadows
01:36:18 <medos> 100% k
01:36:25 <medos> might help
01:36:27 <medos> or somethin'
01:36:28 <medos> no idea
01:36:34 <Kocho> yeah
01:36:43 <Kocho> its not really my style, but i like looking at it
01:36:49 <Kocho> but whenever i try and do it i struggle
01:36:58 <medos> doublestroke everything
01:41:20 <medos> btw
01:44:25 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/hQe0U.png
01:45:36 <medos> something like that will work too to emulato ribbonn shadooows

02:27:00 <Kocho> never heard back from him
02:27:07 <Kocho> but i've got his deposit so it's all good
02:28:23 <Whispery> lol
02:28:24 <Whispery> nice
02:29:47 <Whispery> Blah
02:29:54 <Whispery> I have my type specimen all sketched out

02:32:02 <Whispery> blah
02:33:28 <Whispery> Kocho I have a question
02:33:38 <Whispery> or zakmac too
02:33:38 <Kocho> sure
02:33:40 <Whispery> either one
02:33:52 <Whispery> Do you ever find your mind empty?
02:34:00 <Whispery> Like you're just sitting or working or something
02:34:03 <zakmac> Whats up
02:34:08 <Whispery> and you're just not actually thinking of anything?
02:34:12 <zakmac> Constantly
02:34:20 <Whispery> Not like zoning out though
02:34:21 <Kocho> sometimes I'm not even sure if i have a brain
02:34:24 <zakmac> Sometimes I think its some kind of mental illness
02:34:29 <Whispery> Not zoning out
02:34:35 <Whispery> But like just
02:34:35 <Whispery> calm 
02:34:37 <Whispery> with nothing
02:34:50 <Kocho> but you think of it after you feel like that
02:35:00 <zakmac> There was a couple weeks earlier this year that I just completely lost
02:35:03 <Whispery> What do you mean?
02:35:10 <Whispery> And zakmac, you do meditation right?
02:35:24 <zakmac> Sporadically yes
02:35:28 <Kocho> after that feeling is when you realise you've been feeling that way
02:35:39 <Kocho> i ride my bike with traffic = same thing as meditation
02:35:53 <Whispery> Oh
02:36:02 <Whispery> Zakmac, when you medidate, you're supposed to clear your mind
02:36:04 <Whispery> Empty it
02:36:07 <Whispery> and think of nothing
02:36:07 <Whispery> right?
02:36:16 <zakmac> Dunno, that's not how I do it
02:36:21 <Whispery> How do you do it?
02:36:22 <zakmac> I do a ton of thinking
02:36:33 <Whispery> And Kocho, that sounds like what I feel like when I drive lol
02:36:42 <zakmac> About ideas I have and things I want to do. I focus on breathing and relaxing and working through any problems and blockers
02:36:57 <Whispery> Except it's sort of like I focus in on driving, which requires all of my attention, so I can't think about anything else
02:37:05 <Whispery> Zakmac, that doesn't sound like meditation
02:37:12 <zakmac> It is
02:37:31 <Whispery> Well, I guess there are many types of mediation
02:37:34 <Whispery> .define meditation
02:37:40 <Whispery> hm
02:37:49 <medos> that's how i feel when i work on one piece for hours
02:37:55 <medos> can't do it every day
02:38:00 <medos> but it's immensely enjoyable
02:38:08 <Kocho> ashen i go for a jog or play sport or something - something physical, i love it because i don't think of work or anything else
02:38:14 <Kocho> when* not ashen
02:38:15 <Kocho> lol
02:38:37 <Whispery> Medos, same
02:38:40 <zakmac> .g which us state produces the most turkey?
02:38:45 <Whispery> lol
02:39:10 <medos> Whispery big killer for that is irc
02:39:12 <zakmac> .g how many hens can one tom inseminate?
02:39:24 <zakmac> Aw yeah
02:39:32 <Whispery> Medos, do you feel like your mind is empty when you're working on it though? Or just that all your attention is on your designing so you don't have to think/worry about anything else?
02:39:42 <medos> no, feels natural
02:40:02 <Whispery> So it feels like an organically grown food product?
02:40:08 <Whispery> Or a piece of grass?
02:40:11 <Whispery> Or my skin?
02:40:17 <Whispery> Idk what 'natural' means :P
02:40:37 <medos> if you walk down the street
02:40:49 <medos> do you think about lifting your left foot
02:40:55 <Kocho> yes
02:40:55 <medos> then swinging it forward
02:40:58 <Kocho> yes
02:40:59 <medos> then down
02:41:02 <Kocho> no
02:41:04 <Kocho> leave it up
02:41:10 <medos> then lifting your right foot
02:41:15 <medos> then swinging that forward
02:41:18 <Whispery> Hm
02:41:19 <medos> then placing it downward
02:41:21 <Whispery> Sometimes
02:41:34 <medos> not usually though
02:41:35 <Kocho> i would like some feedback: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%201.40.28%20PM.png
02:41:39 <medos> because walking comes natural
02:41:47 <Whispery> Similar to that "you are now breathing voluntarily" thing
02:41:58 <medos> no
02:42:02 <medos> similar to i just do something
02:42:07 <medos> without thinking about it
02:42:12 <Whispery> yes
02:42:14 <Whispery> involuntarily
02:42:16 <Whispery> lol
02:42:26 <Whispery> you breathe involuntarily most of the time
02:42:38 <Whispery> but the whole point of the 'you are now breathing voluntarily' meme 
02:42:44 <Whispery> is that it makes you think about it
02:42:49 <Whispery> and makes it a voluntary thing
02:42:52 <medos> drifting off
02:42:54 <Whispery> as opposed to the automatic thing
02:42:54 <medos> topic
02:42:58 <medos> doing it
02:42:58 <Whispery> lol
02:43:11 <Whispery> Anyway, I was originally asking my question

02:43:32 <Whispery> because I wonder what it's like to not think about anything
02:43:46 <Whispery> Also, Kocho, give some info about your logo
02:43:53 <Kocho> wedding place
02:44:01 <Whispery> Bottom left looks like some sort of seed
02:44:03 <Kocho> where you can have your wedding
02:44:10 <Whispery> natural whole grain bread plant thing
02:44:21 <Kocho> the wreath is a greek thing
02:44:22 <Whispery> top two looks like a buzzsaw blade
02:44:26 <Whispery> *look
02:44:30 <Kocho> and they have ribbon something or rathers
02:44:35 <Whispery> Middle left looks like wine
02:44:51 <Whispery> I think the wreath could work
02:44:55 <Whispery> But you need to make it more wreathy
02:44:57 <Whispery> and less buzzsawy
02:45:08 <Whispery> See if you can't make it looks like leaves more
02:45:09 <Whispery> or flowers
02:45:12 <Whispery> chicks dig flowers
02:45:17 <Kocho> yep
02:45:17 <Kocho> ok
02:45:27 <zakmac> .g how fast can a turkey fly
02:45:34 <zakmac> And now we know
02:48:55 <medos> (04:44:07) (Whispery): because I wonder what it's like to not think about anything -> http://i.minus.com/ibuAzlnInS7vi0.png -> http://i.minus.com/i9XxQI7sW9mdI.png -> http://i.minus.com/ibhvruxC7Uyrt3.gifhttp://i.minus.com/iBbG2cui42TtX.png
02:49:24 <medos> i think those are some that fall under "just kinda worked on it"
02:50:24 <Whispery> hm
02:50:44 <Whispery> I think that's different than having a totally empty, clear, calm mind
02:50:50 <medos> nope
02:50:54 <Whispery> What you're talking about 
02:50:55 <Whispery> seems more like
02:50:57 <medos> i did not need to think what to do next
02:50:58 <Whispery> the 
02:51:00 <medos> i just continued
02:51:03 <medos> without planning
02:51:04 <Whispery> Yeah, different though 
02:51:08 <Whispery> hold on trying to think of the word
02:51:09 <medos> nope
02:51:13 <medos> meh
02:51:19 <Whispery> that state that like
02:51:20 <medos> topic closed for me
02:51:25 <medos> your case is always different
02:51:27 <medos> i say zen
02:51:31 <medos> you say "naaaaaaay not it"
02:51:33 <Whispery> When I think of the word, you'll understand 
02:53:54 <medos> essentially you were asking what it is like not to worry and just be
02:54:00 <medos> i just told you what that is for me
02:54:03 <Whispery> I can't figure out what the term is
02:54:06 <medos> that it does not compute for you
02:54:15 <medos> is a given
02:54:38 <Whispery> But, as I'm interpreting it (I obviously could be wrong), is that you're talking about that state that really good musicians are known to get in to
02:54:50 <Whispery> where they "lose" themselves in the music
02:54:53 <Whispery> and don't need to think about it
02:55:04 <Whispery> their fingers just move on their own
02:55:06 <medos> altered state of conciousness
02:55:11 <medos> which is
02:55:13 <medos> not thinking
02:55:15 <medos> but doing
02:55:23 <Whispery> Yeah
02:55:28 <medos> trance
02:55:29 <Whispery> What I was asking though was more about like
02:55:31 <medos> essentially
02:55:32 <Whispery> not doing things
02:55:34 <Whispery> not doing anything
02:55:35 <medos> even if it sounds gay
02:55:36 <Whispery> just sitting 
02:55:42 <Whispery> and being able to clear your mind
02:55:45 <Whispery> and just not think for a while
02:56:06 <medos> that's the part where did not read that i did not think
02:56:13 <medos> or am not thinking while doing those pieces
02:56:26 <Whispery> hm
02:56:40 <Whispery> I dunno, I think you're still thinking about it
02:56:42 <Whispery> like
02:56:46 <Whispery> When you're watching a movie
02:56:53 <medos> lol
02:56:54 <Kocho> Whispery do you go to sleep each night
02:56:54 <Whispery> and you're just sitting there enjoying it
02:56:57 <Whispery> not trying to analyze it
02:56:57 <medos> i give up
02:57:05 <Whispery> are you thinking about it?
02:57:12 <Whispery> Kocho, sometimes :P
02:57:16 <Kocho> there you go
02:57:18 <medos> that's not comparable to movie watching
02:57:22 <Kocho> when you're sleeping problem solved

02:59:18 <Whispery> Lemme look
02:59:29 <Whispery> Also, medos, excuses excuses
02:59:30 <Whispery> ;)
02:59:45 <Whispery> Hm
02:59:50 <Whispery> Kocho, I think it's a step forward
02:59:51 <Whispery> But 
03:00:06 <medos> what excuses
03:00:10 <medos> i told you that you walk
03:00:12 <medos> and not think about it
03:00:34 <Whispery> Doing a task without thinking about it != having a totally empty mind
03:00:44 <Whispery> Kocho, it doesn't really look like a /wedding/ wreath to me
03:00:45 <Whispery> http://img4-1.realsimple.timeinc.net/images/09weddings/wedding-wreath_300.jpg
03:00:48 <medos> lol

03:01:15 <medos> at least i know why you can't achieve it ;)
03:01:22 <Whispery> Why
03:01:26 <medos> because it's in box B
03:01:27 <Kocho> i have a picture of the wreath
03:01:32 <Whispery> B?
03:01:39 <medos> Bullshit
03:01:41 <Whispery> Also, Kocho, I think what you have no looks more like
03:01:42 <medos> lelelele
03:01:45 <Whispery> the crown of thorns
03:01:48 <Whispery> or whatver it is
03:01:55 <Whispery> That Caesar wore
03:01:57 <Whispery> or whatever
03:02:05 <Whispery> wait
03:02:06 <Whispery> wow
03:02:10 <Whispery> totally mixing up jesus and caesar
03:02:23 <medos> one made bread the other makes pizza
03:02:25 <Whispery> and the laurel wreath and the crown of thorns
03:02:42 <Whispery> http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d1/Lorbeerkranz_Zypern_rem.jpg is more of what i'm getting now
03:03:25 <Whispery> Kocho, what exactly do you mean by 'wedding place'? Is it a bridal boutiqe? A wedding planner? An actual place to get married?
03:03:36 <Kocho> actual place
03:03:40 <Kocho> like you hire the venue out
03:04:14 <Kocho> it's in greece though and they have these wreaths and ribbon when they get married
03:04:18 <Kocho> and wear it on their head
03:06:19 <Whispery> Hm
03:06:21 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%201.56.14%20PM.png
03:06:22 <Kocho> ugh
03:06:40 <Kocho> i liked this befoe
03:06:44 <Whispery> I like the left one more
03:06:44 <Kocho> before* http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/37223/screenshots/303477/vb.jpg
03:06:59 <Whispery> Yours doesn't look like that
03:07:03 <Kocho> i know
03:07:05 <Kocho> but the style
03:07:33 <Whispery> Yeah, it's cool
03:07:38 <Whispery> Though maybe a little gritty for a wedding place
03:07:47 <Kocho> yeah
03:08:28 <Whispery> I think that the drawing style
03:08:33 <Whispery> With those strokes
03:08:38 <Whispery> could work
03:08:43 <Whispery> but not with that much noise
03:10:28 <Whispery> lol http://dribbble.com/shots/121745-Dribbble-wedding
03:10:48 <medos> Kocho what size is the emblem you're making for?
03:10:51 <medos> letterhead?
03:10:56 <medos> wallfilling?
03:10:56 <Kocho> business card / website
03:11:13 <Whispery> It's amazing how looking through Dribble search results can make me hate styles that I had previously liked
03:11:27 <medos> fix your strokes
03:11:46 <medos> work with size 1 and use a width profile
03:12:00 <Whispery> .g width profile
03:12:13 <Whispery> ooh
03:12:28 <Whispery> Kocho, I'm not sure either of the typefaces you have are working
03:12:34 <Whispery> The one on the right feels much too sterile
03:12:56 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/4hnCo.png
03:13:07 <Whispery> And the one on the left is a lot better, but mixed with the word 'villa', it seems more like a place to rent for a vacation
03:13:16 <medos> bbrb
03:13:17 <Whispery> Though that might just be my american interpretation
03:14:41 <Whispery> Wow, this is really nice imagery for a wedding photographer: http://logopond.com/logos/2f3f260ed862aca829a1ddbb18500e3b.png
03:15:36 <Kocho> bah can't change the name of the company TW lol
03:15:46 <Whispery> Kocho is this the place: http://createbeautifulthings.wordpress.com/2012/03/21/villa-kalliste/#jp-carousel-100
03:16:25 <Kocho> yeah that looks like it
03:17:04 <Whispery> That person's blog post is sort of interesting
03:17:06 <Whispery> if you exit the lightbox
03:17:39 <Kocho> the lightbox is terrible
03:17:44 <Whispery> Yeah
03:17:47 <Whispery> Do they have a website?
03:19:09 <Kocho> i think it's a WIP
03:23:09 <Whispery> Oh
03:23:09 <Whispery> hm
03:23:28 <Whispery> So
03:23:29 <Whispery> is it like
03:23:38 <Whispery> a place for newlyweds to go?
03:23:39 <Whispery> or
03:23:39 <Whispery> like
03:23:44 <Whispery> a place where they rent the entire island
03:23:48 <Whispery> and their entire wedding party goes there?
03:28:11 <Kocho> i think the latter
03:29:42 <Whispery> hm
03:29:48 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%202.29.16%20PM.png
03:30:13 <Whispery> right = best so far
03:30:25 <Whispery> bottom right i mean
03:30:28 <Kocho> yep
03:30:31 <Whispery> hm
03:30:41 <Whispery> I want to feel more 
03:30:43 <Whispery> islandy
03:30:47 <Whispery> when i look at it
03:31:03 <Whispery> y'know, just make the idea of an island POP 
03:31:05 <Whispery> ;)
03:31:10 <Whispery> Sorry I'm being so vague lol
03:31:12 <Kocho> lol
03:32:51 -!- nazbot [~nazbot@24-246-58-30.cable.teksavvy.com] has joined ##reddit-gd
03:34:54 <Whispery> Kocho, do you feel like an adult?
03:35:06 <Kocho> wtf
03:35:06 <Kocho> lol
03:35:55 <Whispery> Just wondering :P
03:36:07 <Whispery> I'm trying to imagine how I would be if I wasn't in school now
03:36:14 <Whispery> but living on my own and working
03:36:29 <medos> lol working
03:38:02 <Whispery> "working"
03:38:05 <Whispery> Sorry, left those out
03:38:45 <medos> you will be lazy, find work, do work, get bored, quit job, start freelancing, get bored and will start an irc channel
03:39:03 <medos> then around the time you do that my kid will start learning graphic design and bug you all day with questions in that very irc channel
03:39:19 <Kocho> sounds like a good life
03:40:37 <medos> Kocho bottom left one
03:40:41 <medos> the ribbon front side
03:40:56 <medos> copy that one, once, then on the copy group the front of the ribbon
03:41:03 <medos> then apply a wave distort via appearance panel
03:41:05 <medos> verrry slightly
03:41:24 <medos> and move the circle stroke below the leaves
03:41:50 <Whispery> Yeah, medos, I'd enjoy that
03:42:09 <Kocho> i didn't understand that medos
03:42:45 <Whispery> I think he meant the entire front face of the ribbon
03:42:53 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/X4at8.png
03:43:12 <Kocho> flag the front
03:43:17 <Whispery> flag it brooo
03:43:47 <Kocho> medos: and move the circle stroke below the leaves
03:43:51 <Kocho> i don't get that part
03:43:52 <medos> yup
03:44:08 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/YBR5q.png
03:44:19 <Kocho> oh yep
03:45:47 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%202.45.23%20PM.png
03:45:58 <Kocho> top right is out ;)
03:46:15 <Kocho> top left is what medos said (I think)
03:46:36 <Whispery> No
03:46:38 <Whispery> Bottom left is
03:46:38 <Whispery> lol
03:46:46 <Kocho> i mean
03:46:47 <Kocho> yeah
03:46:50 <Kocho> bottom left
03:46:53 <Whispery> Add in the dashed stroke again
03:46:54 <Whispery> that was cool
03:46:58 <Whispery> for giving it some texture
03:47:09 <Whispery> though make it a bit less regular
03:47:20 <Whispery> Also, it looks like a sun now
03:47:21 <Kocho> yeah
03:47:23 <Whispery> which is sort of cool
03:47:27 <Whispery> the leaves = the wreath
03:47:31 <Whispery> but also the sun 
03:47:52 <Kocho> i like bottom right :(
03:48:09 <medos> true
03:48:20 <medos> it's a place that rents places for weddings
03:48:39 <medos> might be good not to have it out-class the wedding decoration
03:49:23 <Kocho> i feel like bottom right is classy enough
03:49:23 <Whispery> I think the bottom right one
03:49:26 <Whispery> is sort of generic
03:49:29 <Whispery> and cold
03:49:34 <Kocho> the others feel a bit bakery / wheat farm
03:49:36 <Whispery> simply because the ribbon is so boring
03:49:45 <Whispery> Hm
03:49:52 <Whispery> Maybe the wreath is the wrong way to go
03:49:59 <Whispery> What about doing something like
03:50:05 <Kocho> i have to have a wreath basically
03:50:33 <Whispery> Oh
03:50:35 <Whispery> hm
03:50:38 <Whispery> Well
03:50:44 <Whispery> What about having something more illsutrative too
03:50:44 <Whispery> like
03:50:46 <Whispery> http://astrid.com/
03:50:48 <Whispery> wait no
03:50:49 <Whispery> not that
03:50:58 <Whispery> http://logopond.com/logos/98c7f5cf25c97c4731b3ee2fc44ed203.png
03:51:07 <Whispery> with that type of thing
03:51:08 <Whispery> but
03:51:09 <Whispery> an island
03:51:10 <medos> lol
03:51:11 <Whispery> or w.e
03:51:13 <Whispery> inside the circle
03:51:14 <Kocho> no islands
03:51:15 <Whispery> of the wreath
03:51:16 <Kocho> lol
03:51:17 <Whispery> well
03:51:21 <medos> magically have all skills ever for logos and illustration
03:51:34 <Whispery> lol
03:52:49 <Whispery> blah
03:53:33 <Kocho> ill show you something
03:53:37 <Kocho> i think is better
03:54:27 <Whispery> k
03:54:32 <Whispery> Hey medos, speaking of motivation, http://www.pendulum.org/related/related_add_barkley.html
03:54:56 <medos> i know it's sad stuff
03:55:06 <medos> i know you're unfixable
03:55:13 <Whispery> tl;dr
03:55:14 <medos> i know that document on the internet proves your situation
03:55:22 <Whispery> adhd is correlated with a lack of motivation
03:55:27 <medos> is it
03:55:31 <Whispery> yup
03:55:33 <Whispery> which sucks
03:55:36 <Kocho> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/76565434/Screen%20Shot%202012-10-10%20at%202.54.40%20PM.png
03:55:38 <medos> i think being a human being is related to lack of motivation too
03:55:43 <Whispery> meh
03:55:45 <medos> i'm in danger
03:55:47 <medos> D:
03:55:48 <medos> help
03:55:53 <medos> .g lack of motivation causes
03:55:54 <Whispery> this is how I feel
03:56:02 <Kocho> all those danavai ones look more relevant than my villa ones :(
03:56:31 <Whispery> I think you're falling into the pit of thinking that just because problems can have many causes, that makes my cause less potent than the others.
03:56:54 <medos> nope
03:56:57 <medos> from now on
03:56:59 <medos> i'm sick too
03:57:01 <medos> i decided
03:57:07 <medos> i will google around a bit and find proof tomorrow
03:57:10 <medos> to present to you
03:57:50 <Whispery> Lol
03:58:08 <Whispery> You're also dismissing the fact that I have two professional diagnoses of ADHD
03:58:22 <medos> I'm going to get three if i do my best
03:58:26 <Whispery> And the fact that learning about my condition != wallowing in it
03:58:29 <medos> BEATCHA
03:58:40 <medos> 3>2
03:58:42 <medos> i'm da illest
03:58:43 <Whispery> Kocho, I agree about the danavi ones
03:59:06 <Whispery> Specifically, the top left danavi one
03:59:08 <Whispery> is cool
03:59:54 <Whispery> Medos, sometimes you're an idiot lol
04:00:12 <medos> *illest
04:00:41 <medos> it's the x billionth time that you post adhd stuff
04:00:59 <medos> saying sorry bro won't make you better
04:01:36 <Whispery> Lol 
04:01:46 <Whispery> You also misinterpret what I'm posting for
04:01:50 <Whispery> I'm not looking for sympathy

06:01:56 <zakmac> Hey EDSGD 
06:02:35 <TheWhisper> Zakmac, nah
06:02:42 <TheWhisper> It's pretty much impossible for me to have one, I think
06:02:53 <TheWhisper> Because with my ADD, my thoughts are racing constantly
06:02:56 <TheWhisper> I'm never not thinking 
06:03:01 <EDSGD> ADD
06:03:02 <EDSGD> LOL

06:10:54 <EDSGD> It is nice.

13:45:04 <sigstuff> coated
13:45:23 <sigstuff> pantone has a whole thing about spot vs process and so on
13:45:31 <ruzmutuz> Yeah I read this: http://www.colorguides.net/pantone_spot_color.html
13:46:32 <ruzmutuz> Why does process come out so different to the spot colour?

14:26:55 <sigstuff> anyone uses escrow.com here?
14:28:14 <marshmallow> nope
14:28:37 <marshmallow> looks like a paypal?
14:28:46 <sigstuff> they let you use paypal too
14:29:11 <sigstuff> but the problem is for intl clients they dont seem to allow the service
14:29:46 <sigstuff> but if its jut sending stuff electronically, i think it should be manageable but im finding out on that
14:30:07 <sigstuff> kinda early in california now so id have to wait an hr before i can call them and ask
14:34:37 <marshmallow> ooh
14:34:50 <marshmallow> yea, I never do international transactions
14:34:59 <marshmallow> never had a need
14:35:00 <marshmallow> sorry
14:35:07 <sigstuff> k
14:35:14 <marshmallow> still kinda early for cali
14:35:18 <sigstuff> ye
14:35:53 <sigstuff> there's tons of other art escrow services
14:36:07 <sigstuff> but not sure what's legit
15:11:43 <sigstuff> well that sucks
15:11:45 <sigstuff> i called up escrow
15:12:06 <sigstuff> as far as digital files are concerned, they dont have a say in it nor can they tel if the buyer has received it or downloaded
15:12:29 <sigstuff> basically i'd have to use a 3rd party client and this could go on forever if the buyer claims he didnt receive the file
15:15:49 <marshmallow> booo
15:15:54 <sigstuff> ye
15:16:09 <sigstuff> so whats the point in buying an escrow service if they cant tell if my file has been received
15:16:12 <sigstuff> lol
15:16:19 <marshmallow> hahaha, for reals!

15:46:15 <internetpolice> sigstuff what kind of clients make you want to use escrow services? :|
15:46:37 <TheWhisper> Sigstuff, are you a student, freelancer, or pro?
15:46:42 -!- medos [~medos@unaffiliated/medos] has joined ##reddit-gd
15:47:09 <sigstuff> none but i think if i have to deal with clients online it would be good to have an escrow service
15:47:52 <sigstuff> given the fact there's so much of talent out there, i dont wanna get ripped off
15:48:45 <sigstuff> kunvay.com seems like what i need but im not sure though
15:48:50 <sigstuff> their prices are kinda wonky
15:50:17 <TheWhisper> Medos knows all about conveyor belts
15:51:01 <sigstuff> and then there's this http://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2012/08/23/kunvey-making-copyright-transfers-easy/
15:51:54 <medos> i just go with half upfront half upon completion
15:52:16 <medos> bank transfer
15:52:20 <medos> mh
15:55:48 <medos> i'm not sure how using random escrow services will make your client feel more comfortable
15:56:27 <TheWhisper> Sigstuff, freelancer, student, or pro?
15:57:46 <medos> ask again in 10 minutes
15:58:01 <TheWhisper> I'll ask until I get a response :)
15:59:20 <medos> if you ask again in about 8 minutes you'll keep that 10 minute interval going
16:01:48 <medos> general comment: if you approach clients with the mindset "i might get ripped off" it's going to be tricky to build enough trust to actually enjoy working with anyone
16:03:08 <medos> noo
16:03:27 <medos> .tell thejoot i hope i'll see that vogue ad :)
16:03:52 <TheWhisper> Medos, he linked it

16:23:33 <TheWhisper> I'd use it
16:25:54 <TheWhisper> Well, that's annoying
16:26:18 <TheWhisper> There's no way to integrate NexusFont into Adobe stuff like with Suitcase/FontXplorer?
16:26:28 <TheWhisper> Specifically, have them open together
16:26:33 <TheWhisper> Besides making a bat?
16:27:23 <medos> what's your goal in life? make a 500 font 1 page layout?
16:28:16 <sigstuff> TheWhisper: student
16:28:22 <sigstuff> medos: ye general design work
16:28:25 <sigstuff> no web design
16:28:30 <sigstuff> posters, branding, etc
16:28:38 <sigstuff> im lost i dont know what to do
16:28:53 <medos> make a post in r/g_d
16:28:56 <sigstuff> medos: upfront works for some and not for ome
16:28:57 <sigstuff> some
16:29:08 <medos> true
16:29:22 <sigstuff> if its a small payment like say 300 or so dont expect your client to make an upfront because they're stuck with you then
16:29:41 <medos> i do expect that
16:29:58 <medos> even if it fucks with the amount i'll receive because i'll have transfer rates *2
16:30:22 <sigstuff> what do you mean?
16:30:35 <medos> i'm just being consistent
16:30:59 <medos> i know how i handle my pay i know how to explain it easily i know how to react when a client says "GO!"
16:31:22 <medos> if there's as little "uhhhhh lemme check this" as possible
16:31:38 <medos> your client is less likely to doubt what kind of a guy you are
16:31:58 <medos> if that makes sense
16:32:19 <sigstuff> you dont have a contract?
16:32:25 <sigstuff> you just go by word of trust?
16:32:47 <medos> no i do usually have a contract
16:32:56 <medos> but there's a certain list i go through
16:33:57 <medos> 1. mail contact (2. chat contact) 3. share folder on dropbox or any other system i know 4. find out what the guy wants 5. if he seems unsure about it i'll notice
16:34:07 <medos> it being what he actually wants

16:36:47 <sigstuff> its tricky
16:37:30 <sigstuff> i thought of adding a form for them to fill out with requirements and then chat about it 
16:37:34 <sigstuff> create a sample
16:37:38 <sigstuff> on paper
16:37:50 <sigstuff> but the thing is
16:38:07 <sigstuff> if you can see the concept, nothing is stopping you from copying digital artwork
16:38:10 <sigstuff> nothing
16:38:12 <sigstuff> even if its on paper
16:38:14 <medos> yeah
16:38:19 <medos> you're offering free work?
16:38:34 <sigstuff> the samples ive put a base fee
16:38:34 <medos> i want a website mockup pls
16:38:36 <medos> :D
16:38:38 <sigstuff> that is nonrefundable
16:38:55 <sigstuff> it is refundable during the final payment
16:39:04 <sigstuff> but this in between process is where im lost
16:39:22 <medos> that's your part to figure out, i only put pencil on canvas after payment
16:39:43 <medos> because if a client wants to work with me he should be able to decide so based on stuff i made for other people
16:40:18 <sigstuff> it's competitive
16:40:19 <medos> bye zm
16:40:27 <medos> it is
16:40:43 <marshmallow> make me a webbie =D
16:40:45 <sigstuff> if your clients are mostly online, then either you're really really good or it's references
16:40:52 <marshmallow> actually, make me a email template
16:41:00 <sigstuff> if your clients are word of mouth, like mine, there's no issues
16:41:06 <sigstuff> but with online clients you really have to proove it
16:41:16 <sigstuff> places like dribbbble and behance put you in the back burner
16:41:21 <sigstuff> evne if you're good
16:41:26 <medos> heh
16:41:27 <sigstuff> there's always someone who is one step ahead of you
16:41:32 <sigstuff> online
16:41:35 <TheWhisper> Sigstuff, you have a site?
16:41:40 <sigstuff> so the only way to shut them up is to proove it
16:41:42 <sigstuff> by doing it
16:41:54 <sigstuff> so once they buy into the concept, they'll pay pu
16:41:54 <medos> doing free proofs
16:41:55 <sigstuff> up
16:42:00 <TheWhisper> And Medos, mainly just because I'll open a PSD and then realize I haven't opened Nexus, so I'll have to close PS, open Nexus, and then open PS again
16:42:08 <sigstuff> i do proofs with a fee
16:42:10 <sigstuff> its not free
16:42:26 <sigstuff> TheWhisper: not yet working on it
16:42:36 <TheWhisper> Work examples? :P
16:42:44 <sigstuff> waitfor the site :P

16:43:37 <TheWhisper> ?psd
16:43:48 <medos> TheWhisper you do not have to close ps to make nexus work with neew fonts
16:44:00 <TheWhisper> It doesn't load right when I do the

16:44:12 <TheWhisper> It doesn't load them right
16:44:31 <medos> TheWhisper not update all text layers?
16:44:32 <medos> wtf?
16:44:43 <medos> you just fire up photoshop, open the file, it says font not there
16:44:46 <sigstuff> marshmallow: ye no spec work!
16:44:47 <medos> then you start nexusfont
16:44:52 <medos> decide on the folder
16:45:02 <medos> or click the folder with the fonts
16:45:14 <marshmallow> marshmallow was being lazy =p
16:45:15 <medos> then let mspresentationfoundationfontcache work its magic
16:45:29 <TheWhisper> Lemme try it again then

16:46:28 <TheWhisper> And then it changes the text to the wrong thing if I click okay
16:46:29 <medos> and load the damn fonts
16:46:32 <TheWhisper> Nexusfont is open
16:46:35 <medos> no you do not click

16:47:17 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/iIals.png
16:47:26 <TheWhisper> and it gives me this: http://i.imgur.com/5dZzl.png
16:47:33 <TheWhisper> At this point, I click to open Nexus
16:47:46 <TheWhisper> Nexus is now open
16:47:49 <TheWhisper> and so is the PSD
16:47:51 <sigstuff> shouldnt you go the other way around
16:47:54 <sigstuff> vector -> psd
16:47:55 <medos> select the folder
16:48:00 <TheWhisper> It is selected
16:48:04 <medos> in nexusfont
16:48:07 <medos> make it reload
16:48:07 <TheWhisper> It is
16:48:18 <medos> by switching font folders once
16:48:19 <TheWhisper> Okay
16:48:20 <TheWhisper> Just did
16:48:52 <TheWhisper> Font layers still have the alert overlay
16:49:10 <TheWhisper> And if I click to edit one
16:49:21 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/wE9o3.png pops up
16:49:27 <medos> cool
16:50:45 <sigstuff> anyone on behance
16:50:56 <medos> yeah
16:50:57 <TheWhisper> Well, medos?
16:51:15 <sigstuff> did you get the invite?
16:51:20 <sigstuff> for Union Square Ventures rebranding
16:51:30 <sigstuff> i think they sent it out to everyone
16:51:36 <TheWhisper> Does it work differently for you, medos?
16:52:15 <TheWhisper> Oh wait
16:52:16 <TheWhisper> wow
16:52:41 <medos> you're a turd, i knew exactly why i stopped helping you
16:52:49 <medos> sigstuff no idea, lemme check
16:52:56 <TheWhisper> Well
16:53:06 <TheWhisper> There's the 'replace all missing fonts' option
16:53:09 <TheWhisper> but it's greyed out
16:53:26 <medos> your problem
16:53:27 <medos> :)
16:53:49 <TheWhisper> How does it work when you do it?
16:53:57 <medos> it works
16:54:09 <TheWhisper> You just open nexus and it works?
16:54:13 <TheWhisper> You don't need to replace all or anything?
16:54:22 <medos> .g nexusfont auto activation photoshop
16:55:16 <medos> sigstuff either i did not get that newsletter or i deleted it or it's in my spam folder somewhere
16:55:29 <sigstuff> ah ok
16:55:55 <TheWhisper> Medos, I understand that the fonts are auto activated
16:56:00 <sigstuff> it's got 142 people already in it
16:56:01 <sigstuff> lol
16:56:04 <medos> neat
16:56:12 <TheWhisper> I can make a new layer
16:56:15 <TheWhisper> and type using the font on that one
16:56:28 <TheWhisper> It's just the layers that were already there are not updated 
16:56:48 <medos> you fucked up somewhere along the way
16:56:51 <medos> it works for me
16:56:55 <medos> it works for the rest of the world
16:57:06 <medos> what your problem with font activation is i do not know
16:58:05 <marshmallow> 12:51] <sigstuff> for Union Square Ventures rebranding <-- I didn't get an invite, but there's like an ad on the lower corner of my screen advertising it
16:58:14 <marshmallow> looks like a fancy way to get resumes
16:58:50 <marshmallow> where 5 winners will be asked to make something, all will be compensated.  1 will be chosen as winner and awarded more $
16:59:18 <sigstuff> yeh
17:00:00 <TheWhisper> Lemme try updating my CS6
17:00:06 <medos> no
17:00:27 <medos> it would be advisable to try 20 things and half an hour of googling without reporting back
17:00:45 <medos> because you tend to moan every 5 minutes that something does not work because you're not even trying
17:00:47 <sigstuff> 531 participants
17:00:49 <medos> ?medos
17:00:55 <sigstuff> lol
17:01:19 <marshmallow> 5 chosen and will get $1,500.  From these 5 finalists, one winner will be selected to complete the USV brand identity, receiving a $12,500 payment and credit for the work.
17:01:28 <TheWhisper> Lol
17:01:35 <marshmallow> personally, I think that's good money for 5th place
17:01:48 <medos> link to contest
17:01:50 <sigstuff> if you can be in the top 5
17:01:54 <sigstuff> hardly a chance

17:10:55 <zakmac> Not generally a fan of perm-having dogs but he's adorable
17:11:02 <marshmallow> DOGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGIE!
17:11:09 <marshmallow> i wuv doggies
17:11:16 <TheWhisper> Well, this may have worked

17:11:36 <TheWhisper> I love dogs n cats
17:11:37 <TheWhisper> bro
17:11:50 <zakmac> Borderline personality disorder, TheWhisper 
17:12:01 <TheWhisper> What?
17:12:09 <marshmallow> lol
17:12:26 <zakmac> I've diagnosed you. BPD is the only explanation for people who like both dogs and cats
17:12:30 <TheWhisper> lol
17:12:57 <zakmac> .g borderline personality disorder
17:13:04 <zakmac> Useless
17:13:07 <medos> fits
17:13:11 <medos> complains about stuff
17:13:18 <zakmac> "BPD is a condition in which people have long-term patterns of unstable or turbulent emotions, such as feelings about themselves and others. These inner experiences often cause them to take impulsive..."
17:13:24 <TheWhisper> lol
17:13:51 <zakmac> I like the vague description "They feel things about people and life events."
17:14:06 <zakmac> TheWhisper: Do you sometimes feel emotions?
17:14:10 <TheWhisper> Hm
17:14:11 <TheWhisper> Nah
17:14:23 <zakmac> If no, you're a sociopath. If yes, you have BPD
17:14:30 <medos> he has both
17:14:35 <zakmac> My god
17:14:58 <medos> switches them by the hour
17:15:05 <medos> sociopath at day
17:15:09 <medos> bpd at night
17:15:15 <zakmac> Do dogs know they're cute? Because they always seem to know what to do to be incredibly cute whenever it comes in handy
17:15:26 <TheWhisper> Probably. They're milkin you
17:15:49 <sigstuff> typecode type is nice
17:15:58 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I wonder how they did it
17:15:59 <zakmac> Maybe it's just natural instinct and they're just much more cunning than cats by making us think they're friendly and submissive while actually controlling us to a more exacting degree
17:16:06 <sigstuff> oh the fontpage?
17:16:07 <TheWhisper> cuz if you right click, it's always an image
17:16:11 <sigstuff> i thought it was some css3 stuff
17:16:20 <TheWhisper> idk
17:16:20 <sigstuff> cause it isnt flash from the looks of it
17:16:23 <sigstuff> but i dont know web design
17:16:38 <TheWhisper> It's not flash
17:16:43 <TheWhisper> if you right click on it at any point
17:16:45 <TheWhisper> and do view image
17:16:49 <TheWhisper> it's like each part is an image
