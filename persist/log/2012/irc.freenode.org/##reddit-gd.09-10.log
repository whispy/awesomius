00:02:03 <iSylvir> the divider above riding the metro and before the texts are different weights

00:44:04 <medos> i know another chris but i wouldn't have mentioned him

00:54:01 <Kocho> oh ok
00:54:04 <Kocho> so a bit different
00:54:04 <medos> it's delayed message delivery
00:54:09 <Kocho> nice
00:54:17 <medos> notice being like a single private message
00:54:28 <medos> the thing you never see anywhere apparently

01:24:10 <medos> i'm not TheWhisper
01:24:17 <Kocho> leave scratch post and lindsay by themselves long enough
01:24:22 <medos> LOL
01:24:24 <Kocho> and we get explosion
01:24:36 <medos> btw. i tried to be you https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/1.png
01:24:48 <Kocho> insulting
01:24:55 <medos> sorry
01:24:57 <medos> tried
01:24:57 <Kocho> haha
01:24:59 <Kocho> nah i like that
01:25:01 <medos> :D
01:25:03 <Kocho> ;)
01:25:15 <Kocho> 1 think
01:25:16 <Kocho> thing*
01:25:21 <medos> jaggy
01:25:26 <Kocho> the E, you've shaded the bottom part
01:25:32 <Kocho> like the underneath of it
01:25:41 <Kocho> the rest are on top
01:26:09 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/herpderpderpherp.png
01:26:14 <medos> started like this
01:26:23 <medos> i should probably make it a little either way
01:26:26 <medos> one way
01:26:29 <Kocho> hrmm
01:26:31 <medos> like either dissolve wireframy
01:26:34 <Kocho> i sort of like that second one more
01:26:41 <medos> haha
01:26:53 <Kocho> i think the second two letters should finish that way
01:26:59 <Kocho> and the first two should be like #1
01:27:34 <medos> hmhm
01:28:02 <medos> i might add more wireframe elements
01:28:10 <medos> or it'll look out of balance
01:28:13 <Kocho> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecuksod41Qk&feature=related
01:28:20 <medos> like pure simple wire and full on shading
01:28:29 <Kocho> oh yep
01:28:31 <Kocho> that sounds good
01:28:36 <Kocho> they both look good though :)
01:28:59 <medos> i have 4 wip's more
01:29:01 <medos> D:
01:29:40 <medos> MY WORK FLOW WAS MESSED UP

01:30:48 <medos> well shit nvm
01:30:55 <medos> that one has the shading you disliked
01:31:17 <Kocho> yeah but its fixed on the E yeah?

01:32:19 <Kocho> oh nvm didn't realise you have to purchase
01:33:06 <medos> i'm tempted to start selling shit on graphicriver
01:33:06 <Kocho> lol
01:33:06 <medos> the stupid simplest shit gets attention
01:33:10 <medos> envato is a bunch of idiots though
01:33:11 <Kocho> you could do dribble stuff
01:33:17 <Kocho> and just flog 'em off
01:33:24 <medos> lol
01:33:45 <medos> you mean download dribbble freebies , copy paste layer styles on similar shapes and go hogwild?
01:33:51 <Kocho> lol nah
01:33:56 <medos> good plan tho
01:34:13 <medos> hogwild = sell on envato sites
01:34:15 <medos> lolol
01:34:20 <Kocho> http://graphicriver.net/item/20-blurred-backgrounds/2943528
01:34:21 <Kocho> do that
01:34:22 <Kocho> LOL
01:34:53 <medos> i'm so going to do that
01:34:56 <Kocho> although if you are a company with no graphic skills
01:35:00 <medos> we might just make a collective account
01:35:00 <Kocho> $4 is pretty cheap
01:35:04 <medos> yeah
01:35:06 <medos> also
01:35:14 <medos> envato themselves have no clue what they're doing
01:35:24 <medos> they're running a contest right now
01:35:44 <medos> that said "REWARD FOR FIRST 326PPI RETINA INTERFACE SELLERS"
01:36:07 <medos> turns out they didn't know that 72ppi twice the size files are commonplace and already being sold
01:36:18 <medos> contest still running but they removed the 326ppi shit sadly ;(
01:36:24 <Kocho> :(
01:36:29 <Kocho> lol
01:36:42 <Kocho> they're just interested in making a cut
01:36:53 <medos> yeah
01:37:07 <medos> but seriously, i could pump out quality buttons all day
01:37:19 <medos> running a fucking shop and have customers is tedious
01:37:26 <medos> -fucking
01:37:35 <medos> i'm not that passionate about shops
01:37:40 <Kocho> lol
01:39:27 <medos> btw. i love how they both properly abbreviate adobe tools
01:39:37 <medos> Ps, Ae,
01:39:45 <medos> Pr
01:39:47 <Kocho> yeah
01:39:51 <Kocho> lol
01:40:09 <Kocho> i thought it was going to get more heated
01:40:19 <Kocho> but i misread the situation :(
01:40:39 <Kocho> i don't really read what they say because i don't know what they're talking about
01:40:48 <medos> yeah
01:40:58 <medos> collab?
01:41:12 <medos> or him helping her
01:41:43 <medos> oh btw.: i know what moss looks like now
01:41:46 <Kocho> i don't understand anything video
01:41:53 <medos> i think he's my only follower on vimeo
01:41:59 <Kocho> LOL
01:42:20 <TheWhisper> ugh
01:42:22 <Kocho> whats the link again?
01:42:23 <TheWhisper> my mouse stopped working
01:42:30 <Kocho> to your video?
01:42:34 <TheWhisper> Well, half stopped working
01:42:44 <TheWhisper> I don't even know what is wrong with it
01:42:50 <TheWhisper> It clicks and scrolls fine
01:42:59 <TheWhisper> but if I try to move it around, it just flickers around
01:43:09 <TheWhisper> If I use the pad on my laptop, that works
01:43:11 <medos> ok maybe not
01:43:18 <TheWhisper> and if I put the mouse on my shirt and move it around
01:43:19 <TheWhisper> it works fine
01:43:19 <medos> https://vimeo.com/iammichaelbuck/following/followers/sort:date
01:43:25 <TheWhisper> just when it's on my desk it doesn't work
01:43:33 <medos> i thought that's him because he asked "y u no upload to vimeo'
01:43:40 <TheWhisper> Do laser mice not work on white surfaces?
01:43:47 <Kocho> lol
01:43:48 <medos> nope
01:43:55 <TheWhisper> That's weird though
01:43:59 <TheWhisper> because it worked on this desk
01:43:59 <Kocho> i don't think moss is arabic
01:44:01 <TheWhisper> for like 3 weeks
01:44:29 <TheWhisper> I don't get why it would work for 3 weeks on this surface and then stop working lol
01:44:42 <medos> it will though
01:44:50 <TheWhisper> ?
01:44:56 <TheWhisper> Are you saying it should work on a white desk?
01:44:56 <medos> don't believe anything google might tell you
01:45:00 <medos> it will stop working
01:45:03 <medos> i know bro
01:45:17 <TheWhisper> So why does it just stop working?
01:45:24 <TheWhisper> after working on it fine for a few weeks?
01:45:32 <medos> because it'll get old and break
01:45:58 <TheWhisper> Hm
01:46:00 <TheWhisper> I did just drop it
01:46:07 <TheWhisper> So that's probably why
01:46:22 <TheWhisper> but if it works on other surfaces, I wonder why dropping it broke it on white lol
01:46:41 <medos> (05:03:12) (hugo_moss): lets see a new vimeo video
01:46:48 <medos> i never linked moss to vimeo
01:46:53 <medos> loll

02:06:44 <medos> browser+ task bar = i only see blue
02:06:55 <medos> i should at leeeast see a little more in my opinion
02:07:14 <Kocho> ok
02:07:22 <Kocho> the look of the design is all him
02:07:33 <Kocho> he gave me certain elements of websites he liked
02:07:38 <medos> ah
02:07:38 <Kocho> and i basically just copied it
02:07:54 <Kocho> but i know what you mean
02:08:02 <Kocho> i'll fix it ;)
02:08:31 <medos> yeah
02:08:38 <medos> the design looked a bit hm
02:08:43 <medos> like default website
02:08:50 <medos> not really sure how to call it
02:09:05 <medos> average-web2.0-startup-style
02:09:12 <medos> which is good
02:10:33 <medos> Kocho 550px for the blue
02:10:35 <medos> area
02:10:38 <medos> sounds safe
02:10:57 <Kocho> ok
02:11:01 <Kocho> so take around 60 off
02:11:05 <Kocho> that sounds good
02:11:15 <medos> <- lenovo 1366x768 business laptop screen
02:11:41 <Kocho> im 2560 x 1440
02:11:42 <Kocho> so
02:11:49 <medos> so that's a valid reason to make it fit a little
02:11:56 <Kocho> yep
02:11:57 <medos> more fitting for laptop guys
02:11:57 <Kocho> ;)
02:12:01 <Kocho> yep i agree
02:12:20 <medos> you told me you don't have the 27" sickness D:

03:08:15 <TheWhisper> My hands cups it very nicely

03:08:41 <TheWhisper> http://cdn.overclock.net/6/60/6057b201_claw-grip-palm-grip.jpeg
03:10:01 <EDSGD> 10hours of tutoring last weeeel
03:10:02 <medos> ye
03:10:04 <medos> i do both
03:10:45 <TheWhisper> I feel like the claw would be harder on a larger mouse
03:14:45 <TheWhisper> I think I'm just gonna buy another one of this mouse
03:15:26 <medos> no
03:15:29 <TheWhisper> lol
03:15:35 <TheWhisper> What then?
03:15:45 <TheWhisper> I want something I can claw with
03:16:06 <medos> http://www.golocal-media.de/06c9539c9eb790839df8783db2767951/700/e4fa4d02b2ac1618.jpg
03:16:16 <medos> don't your stores have a row of devices to test?
03:16:18 <medos> like
03:16:30 <TheWhisper> I mean
03:16:32 <TheWhisper> yeah
03:16:39 <medos> over here it's commonplace to have every mouse that is being sold on a shelf
03:16:41 <TheWhisper> there's a best buy
03:16:45 <medos> to touch it
03:16:49 <medos> grip it
03:17:01 <TheWhisper> stroke it?
03:17:03 <medos> then go home and buy it online
03:17:05 <medos> no
03:17:07 <medos> lame
03:17:22 <TheWhisper> http://www.golocal-media.de/06c9539c9eb790839df8783db2767951/700/e4fa4d02b2ac1618.jpg
03:17:33 <TheWhisper> I don't think they'll have any good mice though
03:17:35 <TheWhisper> but idk
03:17:42 <TheWhisper> whoops
03:17:43 <TheWhisper> I meant
03:17:43 <TheWhisper> http://goo.gl/IJPWT
03:18:14 <TheWhisper> I lied, their site has tons of brands
03:18:42 <medos> if your electronics store don't carry logitech mice
03:18:46 <TheWhisper> they do lol
03:18:46 <medos> wtf else should they sell?
03:18:52 <TheWhisper> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Logitech+-+M510+Wireless+Mouse+-+Blue/3435677.p?id=1218402125209&skuId=3435677
03:20:28 <medos> at least i know why you never design anything
03:20:44 <medos> if it's uncomfy it's obvious that you wont touch ps/ai/id
03:21:21 <TheWhisper> lool
03:21:27 <TheWhisper> it's not uncomfortable though
03:21:37 <TheWhisper> Maybe I just don't remember what real mouse feels like though ;(
03:21:43 <TheWhisper> I'll go to the store tomorrow and look
03:22:30 <medos> look at some medium sized ambidextrous mice
03:22:48 <medos> they usually have a centerindentthingie
03:22:48 <medos> wait
03:22:55 <TheWhisper> ?
03:23:04 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/handmodel-casting-application.png
03:23:24 <medos> that's me trying to explain how i hold my mouse
03:24:03 <medos> depending on what i do i switch between claw and palm grip
03:24:10 <TheWhisper> what
03:24:21 <TheWhisper> are you sure?
03:24:23 <TheWhisper> palm is where
03:24:32 <TheWhisper> the left side of the mouse
03:24:35 <TheWhisper> or in your case
03:24:37 <TheWhisper> right side of the mouse
03:24:47 <medos> sry
03:24:48 <TheWhisper> is under your inner thumb 
03:24:49 <TheWhisper> thing
03:24:50 <medos> will take more pix
03:24:57 <medos> showing every possible way i hold my mouse
03:24:59 <medos> wait
03:25:01 <medos> 30 minutes
03:25:07 <medos> i'll grab those
03:25:12 <TheWhisper> http://assets.razerzone.com/peripherals-guide/mouse/images/palmgrip-illus01.jpg
03:25:17 <TheWhisper> nah look
03:25:20 <TheWhisper> that's palm
03:25:20 <medos> oh dude
03:25:23 <medos> it's a pic
03:25:27 <medos> of me showing the size of my mouse
03:25:27 <TheWhisper> that's how you hold yours?
03:25:35 <medos> i hold mine with either 1. fingertips
03:25:42 <medos> or 2. slide it with my palm resting on it
03:25:48 <medos> 3. continue
03:25:55 <TheWhisper> lemme take a pic
03:26:01 <medos> ...
03:26:03 <medos> ttyl
03:26:04 <medos> ;)
03:26:30 <medos> big movements and rough work = claw , finer detail adjustments = palm
03:26:35 <medos> that's all
03:26:42 <medos> sorry for not making a pic for your case
03:27:34 <medos> sorry for trying to help ya out
03:28:24 <TheWhisper> wait
03:28:25 <TheWhisper> no
03:28:26 <TheWhisper> don't go
03:28:28 <TheWhisper> nooo
03:28:32 <TheWhisper> wait
03:28:36 <TheWhisper> fine adjustments = palm?
03:28:38 <TheWhisper> that's weird
03:28:43 <TheWhisper> palm is usually less precise
03:28:50 <TheWhisper> fingertip > claw > palm
03:28:53 <TheWhisper> in terms of precission
03:28:55 <TheWhisper> *prescision
03:28:59 <TheWhisper> fingertip is most
03:29:01 <TheWhisper> and palm is least
03:29:53 <medos> (03:42:23) (@TheWhisper): my mouse stopped working
03:29:59 <medos> (05:29:01) (@TheWhisper): and palm is least
03:30:05 <TheWhisper> ?
03:30:09 <TheWhisper> what?
03:30:09 <medos> you derail so hard you could make stand up comedy look like a fucking funeral
03:30:10 <medos> lol
03:30:17 <TheWhisper> no
03:30:20 <TheWhisper> this is about mice
03:30:25 <TheWhisper> lol
03:30:34 <medos> i said get a medium sized one
03:30:40 <medos> to be able to both claw and palm
03:30:44 <medos> you said
03:30:48 <medos> some stuff for two hours
03:30:54 <medos> and will for some more
03:30:57 <medos> not sure
03:31:32 <TheWhisper> lol

03:50:22 <TheWhisper> lol
03:50:30 <TheWhisper> watch the vidya
03:50:36 <medos> TheWhisper whenever you move your index finger and thumb backwards to grip the mouse with your palm
03:50:46 <medos> it looks crampy
03:51:10 <TheWhisper> hm
03:51:23 <TheWhisper> I don't palm grip though?
03:51:25 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/FPWKv.png
03:51:29 <TheWhisper> It's never that far back
03:51:33 <medos> your palm rests
03:51:39 <medos> on the desk/paper
03:51:40 <medos> whatever
03:51:41 <EDSGD> That does not look confortable
03:51:45 <medos> ^

04:12:31 <Kocho> haha
04:12:46 <EDSGD> LOL
04:13:19 <EDSGD> Did school children have it hard back in the olde days if they were left handed?
04:13:30 <TheWhisper> yes
04:14:05 <TheWhisper> http://www.anythingleft-handed.co.uk/superstitions.html
04:14:31 <TheWhisper> "At various times in history, left-handedness has been seen as many things: a nasty habit, a mark of the devil, a sign of neurosis, rebellion, criminality, and homosexuality. It has also been seen as a trait indicating creativity and musical abilities.b"
04:14:52 <TheWhisper> "The word left in English comes from the Anglo-Saxon word lyft, which means weak or broken."
04:15:02 <EDSGD> Interesting. I'm going to ask old people.
04:15:09 <TheWhisper> "Tests conducted by St. Lawrence University in New York found that there were more left-handed people with IQs over 140 than right-handed people. Famous left-handed intellectuals include Albert Einstein, Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, and Benjamin Franklin.b"
04:15:10 <EDSGD> :p
04:15:24 <TheWhisper> "The German for left-handed is linkisch, which means awkward, clumsy, and maladroit. In Italian, the word is mancino, which is derived from crooked or maimed (mancus) and is also used to mean deceitful or dishonest. In Russian, to be called a left-hander (levja) is a term of insult.d"
04:15:43 <TheWhisper> "Among the Eskimos, every left-handed person is viewed as a potential sorcerer. In Morocco, left-handers are considered to be a sga, a word that means either a devil or a cursed person.d"
04:16:11 <TheWhisper> etc etc
04:17:08 <EDSGD> cool
04:17:17 <EDSGD> wish I were left handed
04:17:26 <EDSGD> :p

04:22:39 <medos> not comparing
04:22:39 <Kocho> and will download
04:22:40 <Kocho> and use
04:22:44 <medos> but i fucking love pixel patterns
04:24:48 <EDSGD> http://i.imgur.com/25q3L.png
04:24:50 <EDSGD> :p
04:25:42 <EDSGD> nice medos thanks :D
04:26:35 <EDSGD> That download button should be more prominent
04:28:25 <medos> i shared all those patterns a few times already
04:28:34 <medos> looks less fun if it's in a single zip file apparently
04:28:35 <medos> :p
04:29:10 <medos> EDSGD you should even have one more pack of ppaterns
04:29:29 <EDSGD> too many 
04:29:43 <medos> meh
04:31:12 <medos> you might as well start checking out freebie files
04:31:16 <TheWhisper> medos
04:31:17 <TheWhisper> "the mamba is ambidextrous right? i need a left hand mouse
04:31:17 <TheWhisper> Almost, there are buttons for the right thumb that wont be thumb side if you use it left handed. Its also slightly different cut in at the bottom of the right side, so your thumb rests a little inward more. But the buttons are all completely programmable. Im not sure what your used to in terms of Left handed mice, but its deffinatly not completely ambidextrous, but probably usable ( i think)"
04:31:19 <medos> and snagging those patterns
04:31:49 <medos> TheWhisper don't worry about me, i can choose a mouse by myself
04:32:07 <TheWhisper> lol

04:32:47 <TheWhisper> Why not get a deathadder?
04:32:50 <TheWhisper> which is made for lefties
04:33:04 <medos> i'm just saying that freebies tend to have patterns in them that might be hard to come by / useful
04:33:21 <TheWhisper> http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-deathadder-left-hand-edition/
04:33:21 <medos> i also am not mean i just tried to prevent random questions

05:10:01 <EDSGD> :p
05:11:14 <medos> what's your approach when making those?
05:12:49 <EDSGD> random crap/ nonsense that in a way seem to fit lol :p
05:14:34 <EDSGD> I should have done a timelapse
05:15:28 <medos> so many straight horizontal lines
05:15:55 <EDSGD> k time for the warp tool 
05:17:02 <medos> ctrl+t i'd say
05:17:39 <EDSGD> Seems better
05:18:22 <EDSGD> Thank you medos http://i.imgur.com/kGlIo.png
05:18:25 <medos> Kocho is there a way to make the 1px selection tool align with rotation?
05:18:46 <Kocho> align with rotation?>
05:19:39 <Kocho> what do you mean?
05:19:50 <medos> upplerd snapshot
05:19:52 <medos> 1 sec
05:20:34 <medos> nggggh snapshot tool died
05:20:53 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/yJz0H.png
05:21:13 <medos> Rotate canvas vs 1px selection horizontal
05:21:17 <medos> lhm
05:21:45 <Kocho> oh
05:21:54 <Kocho> so you want the 1px to select at say 45 degrees?
05:22:04 <Kocho> or 30 degrees
05:22:04 <Kocho> etc
05:22:16 <medos> that would be the dirty solution
05:22:20 <medos> but if i tilt my canvas
05:22:27 <medos> it never affects the selection features
05:22:32 <Kocho> ahh
05:22:50 <medos> e.g. : http://i.imgur.com/yPlhq.png
05:24:08 <TheWhisper> edsgd wtf is that
05:24:30 <medos> i'll probably just do the shift thing with 1px pencil tool
05:24:42 <Kocho> hrmm
05:24:44 <Kocho> yeah I'm not sure
05:25:12 <Kocho> create a line?
05:25:18 <Kocho> with the line tool - selection?
05:25:45 <EDSGD> This ? http://i.imgur.com/kGlIo.png
05:25:51 <medos> same behaviour as selection tool
05:26:00 <medos> tilts with the canvas
05:26:11 <medos> rotating hm
05:26:12 <medos> hmhm
05:26:17 <medos> alright that works

12:10:37 <medos> hey vadoo
12:10:38 <medos> :)
12:10:54 <vadoo> hi medos
12:11:34 <medos> Any updates on your mouse-trail-magic?
12:11:51 <vadoo> not really :)
12:12:20 <vadoo> i made the prototype rather quickly and I'm rewriting large parts now to get it to a maintanable state
12:13:08 <medos> neat
12:13:17 <vadoo> I hope I'll have enough time this week to finish a basic version and send it for feedback
12:14:27 <medos> Sounds like the usual thing devs do.
12:14:38 <vadoo> I never really got your story though (apart from the fact that you know your have some pretty sweet UX tips)
12:15:06 <vadoo> do you do websites / webapps?
12:15:32 <medos> I'm too tired to pull a prince of bel air thing so i'll just link a video or two?
12:15:43 <vadoo> sure
12:16:01 <medos> Worked at a newspaper, got bored by not really learning anything, did some jobs inbetween and now freelancing.
12:16:14 <medos> https://vimeo.com/49093187
12:16:26 <medos> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8VPc-kgV6o
12:16:29 <medos> and that
12:23:16 <vadoo> nice
12:24:15 <vadoo> it's amazing how much work a real designer has to put in for a single icon
12:24:32 <medos> i didn't know there were fake ones :O
12:24:44 <vadoo> take me for example :)
12:24:46 <medos> it's like a realdoll that makes logos? haha
12:25:04 <medos> i thought you're a dev :-P
12:25:21 <vadoo> I am a web developer, but I sometimes do design (photoshop) work for simple websites with very limited budget
12:26:47 <medos> can use computer, can make buttons and a database and css and debug anything and learn all the things
12:26:54 <medos> signed - the average client
12:27:37 <medos> I know a lot of guys are looking for all-in-one solutions. Sometimes it fits and there are more than enough guys out there who do both design and coding well.
12:27:54 <medos> s/guys/clients s/guys/freelancers
12:28:12 <vadoo> well I'm pretty mediocre in design
12:28:29 <vadoo> rounded corners / shadow / inner glow, done :P
12:28:30 <medos> define mediocre!
12:28:33 <medos> ah
12:28:36 <vadoo> that sort of thing
12:29:25 <medos> yup, i bet you get most of that stuff done with the endless amount of tutorials and freebies available
12:30:51 <medos> no offense, it's an advantage even for me
12:30:55 <medos> :P
12:31:10 <vadoo> i know
12:31:12 <vadoo> brb
12:31:16 <medos> alright
12:55:51 <vadoo> ok, fire extingushed
12:56:51 <vadoo> so, I was saying, I find it really hard to convince small time clients that they need to invest in a design
12:58:20 <medos> .rem psd https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/designstuff.txt
12:58:23 <medos> :D
12:58:26 <medos> hmmmm
13:00:52 <medos> It's a common problem. Not really sure if it's possible for you to explain the importance of design.
13:01:07 <medos> You would need to explain a field you never really learned.
13:02:49 <medos> + Every client is different so there's no real step-by-step solution for this.
13:03:48 <vadoo> well, business-wise, for a website it should be self evident that you benifit from a good design
13:04:50 <medos> Yup, there's a huge number of people who just aren't knowledgeable enough to know what the difference between a css animation and a photoshop exported .png button is.
13:05:15 <medos> Requires very specific knowledge to tell frontend/backend/design apart.
13:05:59 <vadoo> you are getting too technical. I think the problem is simpler 
13:06:24 <vadoo> there are too many people (like me, for example) that could produce something presentable for a client
13:06:51 <vadoo> the client is not in a good position to judge whether it is a good design
13:06:57 <medos> Sounds like you hate yourself for being able to do that. :P
13:07:12 <vadoo> well I wish I didn't have to
13:07:53 <vadoo> because I know I'm very mediocre at it while I am pretty good at other stuff
13:08:59 <medos> Yup, that would be a thing i'm upfront about: Building valid and flexible websites is not my strength.
13:10:10 <medos> Still happens though, so i'm in a similar boat with the occasional css/html/js tinkering.
13:10:33 <vadoo> sounds like we should trade :P
13:11:42 <medos> One thing i can tell you is that a designer will not fix your problem.
13:12:26 <medos> Getting hired to make a website pretty and doing so again and again and again just because the product isn't selling.
13:13:57 <medos> Or having a client with a very particular idea who is happy with a crap result.
13:14:53 <vadoo> I know. But i'm not in a position to choose clients right now unfortunately
13:14:55 <medos> Not sure how easy it would be to trade small snippets of workload. :P
13:16:19 <vadoo> I'd be happy to trade work, but the budgets I'm regularly working with wouldn't interested someone good
13:16:47 <vadoo> how much would you charge per hour? (you dont have to answer that, of course)
13:17:55 <medos> That's hard to say , gimme an example of what you would need.
13:19:46 <medos> It's pretty hard to fix a site just with a few cool new elements.
13:19:55 <medos> Sometimes that would be easy, sometimes impossible.
13:20:15 <vadoo> website design from scratch, eshop, 3 psds  (front page, catalog and product page) + logo design
13:20:47 <vadoo> give me a very rough estimate for the design 
13:21:39 <medos> D:
13:21:59 <medos> logo design
13:22:05 <medos> for me would usually be around 400-600
13:22:30 <medos> Not sure if that would apply for a small e-shop though.
13:22:49 <vadoo> I can stop you right there :)

13:23:02 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/accession-01.pdf
13:23:19 <medos> ^ Work in progress on something a little more than just a logo.
13:24:42 <vadoo> usually the total budget for code, setup, design and seo is around: 2000-2500
13:25:15 <vadoo> allocated to design is at most 1000 (and that's really stretching it)
13:26:24 <vadoo> with these budgets I find it hard to get good designers interested

13:27:00 <medos> sorry caps
13:27:12 <medos> Yeah, one off price is more comfortable for me
13:27:22 <vadoo> is it?
13:27:27 <medos> yup
13:27:53 <medos> 1 sec :P
13:28:08 <vadoo> the design process can get out of hand sometimes with the client doing a ton of itterations
13:28:20 <medos> (!)
13:28:21 <medos> haha
13:28:36 <medos> that's part of the problem
13:29:49 <medos> If the client wants a shitload of itterations he either wasn't informed well enough from the getgo.
13:29:58 <medos> Or he has far too much leverage in what is going to happen.
13:31:05 <vadoo> how do you inform someone from the getgo, on a design project?
13:31:17 <medos> talktalktalktalk
13:31:34 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/brief-logo.pdf
13:32:00 <vadoo> some clients start modestly but after the fist iterations they see you as an extension of their imagination and they feel like they are creating through you
13:32:33 <medos> before there's a contract at all the client would have to answer shitloads of questions and if he's up for it sort through a pile of logos to decide on a style
13:32:34 <medos> eg
13:32:36 <medos> :
13:33:12 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/JwLdk.png
13:33:15 <medos> stuff like this
13:33:29 <medos> if the client starts getting funky somewhere in the middle
13:33:38 <vadoo> LOL 
13:33:43 <medos> he just didn't know what to expect

13:49:52 <medos> vadoo not sure if i made it sound too horrible but a major aspect of doing good work for me would be grasping and understanding what the client does
13:50:24 <medos> so just offering stuff out of the box or for a rough fixed price sounds adventurous
13:50:36 <medos> not in a good way :p

13:54:38 <medos> Alas it does not?
13:54:43 <demonicblackcat> so I never really toyed around with the idea of graphic design
13:54:54 <demonicblackcat> yeah, I just found out that design is really the basic that I need
13:55:31 <demonicblackcat> plus, I spent about 17 years of my life (anyway, just before going to uni) drawing and illustrating, so having bombarded with 'design' assignments really made me hate design at first
13:56:15 <medos> Ah, there's a fluent transition. ;)
13:56:38 <medos> Just a lot of small tiny things to watch out for.
13:57:09 <medos> Mind showing some work/illustrations/drawings you made?
13:57:12 <demonicblackcat> Yep, graphic design is very delicate. The size and everything can make everything looks different
13:57:16 <demonicblackcat> I'm absolutely baffled
13:57:18 <demonicblackcat> Sure.

13:59:11 <medos> Neat.
13:59:55 <medos> Swell shading, I love the turqoise scarf on your first link. :)
14:00:04 <demonicblackcat> thanks :)
14:00:19 <demonicblackcat> but still I mostly suck at designing and layouting
14:00:43 <demonicblackcat> and illustrator is still mostly an alien to me lol
14:00:47 <demonicblackcat> what do you do, meods?
14:01:01 <medos> I <3 Illustrator mainly.
14:01:14 <medos> Photoshop a little, not nearly as much though.
14:01:46 <demonicblackcat> Really? What do you do with illustrator?
14:01:47 <demonicblackcat> logos?
14:01:48 <medos> I make logos, illustrations (a few), interface design, buttons.
14:01:51 <medos> Not only.
14:02:08 <demonicblackcat> oh
14:02:28 <medos> I really like the flexibility of everything being scalable, smaller or larger.
14:02:43 <demonicblackcat> Are you a freelancer or part of a design company?
14:02:45 <medos> And if done right even illustrator work can look detailed enough.
14:02:49 <medos> Freelancer.
14:02:55 <demonicblackcat> Well, that's illustrator alright
14:03:21 <demonicblackcat> How long have you been freelancing?
14:03:21 <medos> yup, steep learning curve but once it clicks it gets more and more fun
14:03:31 <medos> 4 years i think
14:04:37 <demonicblackcat> that's a long time
14:04:49 <demonicblackcat> were you studying design specifically in a uni?
14:04:53 <medos> Worked at a newspaper, didn't like the work too much so I tried to do stuff on my own, wasn't easy at first but i'm learning and enjoying work a lot more with a way to decide what happens
14:05:19 <medos> I'm in Germany, it's common here to do both studies and work at the same time.
14:05:45 <medos> So I worked at said newspaper for 4 days of the week and one day a week was spent at uni.
14:06:14 <demonicblackcat> to my point of view as a student, that's tough
14:06:34 <medos> It was fun though ;)
14:07:09 <demonicblackcat> haha
14:07:10 <medos> To the point where I realized that i would never really progress when continuing my work there.
14:07:35 <demonicblackcat> so you quit the newspaper work?
14:08:33 <medos> Yup, most of my colleagues were above 40 and started with letterpress, went to photo layout (sorry forgot the english term for that :P) and then had to work on mac osx
14:09:24 <medos> I did learn a lot of basics that i would've missed in other places but after 2 years there was really nothing anyone could've showed me that i didn't know already.
14:09:31 <demonicblackcat> lol, but newspaper, man, it's a fast line of work
14:09:52 <demonicblackcat> well, i didn't know because i never worked before
14:09:53 <medos> yup, it's a verrry strict and consistent system though
14:10:09 <demonicblackcat> but teachers told me that working is whatever that designers really need to study
14:10:17 <demonicblackcat> makes me wonder why the school took up 4 years
14:10:25 <medos> haha
14:10:34 <demonicblackcat> but still there are a lot of horror stories of designers, you know
14:10:37 <medos> Doesn't help regretting that either. :)
14:11:01 <demonicblackcat> like not getting enough money, or not getting synced with the clients, I'm still trying to overcome that fear
14:11:12 <demonicblackcat> yep, I'm in my last year already so no regret haha
14:11:31 <medos> if you approach clients with an equal or even just half of the energy that you showed when coming in here you should be fine no matter what
14:11:41 <medos> ;)
14:11:59 <medos> Hey , i'll be right back, going for a smoke, should take 5 minutes at most.
14:12:07 <demonicblackcat> haha ok :)
14:14:12 <vadoo> hey, demonicblackcat:, I really like your "emma" drawing - I see you have a thing for reddit favs :)
14:14:29 <demonicblackcat> Lol, I'm not a karmawhore, I swear
14:14:50 <vadoo> I'll take your word on that for now :)
14:15:00 <demonicblackcat> *for now* for now*fornow
14:15:17 <demonicblackcat> anyway, vadoo, what do you do?
14:15:30 <vadoo> I'm a web developer
14:15:54 <medos> back
14:15:59 <vadoo> very little to do with graphic design
14:16:07 <medos> enough to stop by :)
14:16:26 <demonicblackcat> lol, web developer
14:16:39 <vadoo> more of a design enthousiast, not a design professional
14:16:52 <demonicblackcat> well, the same applies to me 
14:17:11 <medos> Don't worry, a few people here know what they're doing.
14:17:25 <demonicblackcat> so correct me if I'm wrong, but web developer is a programmer, right?
14:17:43 <vadoo> yeah, definetly don't judge by me :)
14:17:44 <vadoo> yes
14:18:01 <demonicblackcat> but still, I saw the tumblr blog and I'm surprsed at how good the photomanipulations are
14:18:42 <demonicblackcat> nah, I don't. it's kinda normal to want to look at types and such when you're staring at numbers too long hahaha
14:19:23 <medos> If you do design work you'll end up working with some coding fellas sooner or later.
14:20:02 <demonicblackcat> hmmhmm
14:20:29 <medos> Can't design a website without having some idea of how a website is being created.
14:21:05 <demonicblackcat> yeah, I understand
14:21:34 <demonicblackcat> we'll be wanting to do the impossinby hard to do 
14:21:57 <demonicblackcat> anyway, medos, you use illustrator right?
14:22:06 <demonicblackcat> do you buy it yourself?
14:22:35 <medos> yeah
14:22:47 <demonicblackcat> wow
14:23:24 <medos> To be fair it's getting cheaper with cs6
14:23:39 <demonicblackcat> oh, so you upgrade things?
14:23:39 <medos> as opposed to having a lethal upgrade every year that'll costttttt
14:23:47 <medos> it's a little each month
14:24:06 <demonicblackcat> wow, maybe it's just the people in my country
14:24:15 <medos> Where do you live?
14:24:16 <demonicblackcat> byut the concept of buying adobe products is new to us
14:24:20 <medos> haha
14:24:23 <demonicblackcat> indonesia
14:24:44 <demonicblackcat> if it cost around50 dollars, then fnie, some might want to buy it
14:24:57 <medos> Not the only country where it is like that. :)
14:25:08 <demonicblackcat> but it's so friggin expensive that everyone that I know, even the school that I go to to in malaysia, all use the torrent version 
14:25:22 <demonicblackcat> haha yeah? but I heard in the western country it's far stricter?
14:25:29 <medos> I know a guy who lives and works on the Maldives and they have a state-funded network where you can download Photoshop and Movies for free.
14:25:43 <medos> Pirated. :-P
14:25:52 <medos> It's not stricter.
14:26:42 <medos> It's just that the price is not as harsh compared to what one project can earn you.
14:27:27 <medos> Monthly fee of less than 100 bucks for tools that will be earned in no time.

14:30:57 <medos> yup.
14:31:35 <medos> How far are you into learning and grasping design principles?
14:41:00 <medos> demonicblackcat by the way, it's kinda rude to ask for stuff you did and not showing anything myself. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvZa_rMtx6M <- me using illustrator

16:43:56 <TheWhisper> and it's not weird
16:44:05 <demonicblackcat> but the one on the cold is not a chick, it's a guy
16:44:09 <demonicblackcat> a super pretty guy haha
16:44:15 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I thought so
16:44:17 <demonicblackcat> yep, 
16:44:17 <TheWhisper> but couldn't tell
16:44:19 <demonicblackcat> reply soo late
16:44:21 <TheWhisper> and it looked like there was a little boobage
16:44:21 <demonicblackcat> anyway, need to go sleep, too
16:44:23 <TheWhisper> so I went with chick
16:46:08 <TheWhisper> okay
16:46:10 <TheWhisper> mouse
16:46:11 <TheWhisper> no sleep

16:46:37 <TheWhisper> ^
17:03:26 <CottonBalls> My stupid cat woke me up at 5 and I couldn't fall back asleep.
17:19:26 <medos> haha
17:19:43 <medos> Shied a cat away.
17:20:37 <medos> marshmallow how's the camera coming along?
17:20:52 <marshmallow> hokay, working on the lens
17:21:23 <marshmallow> found a tutorial, learning some new stuff
17:22:04 <medos> There are tutorials for camera icons? D:
17:23:55 <marshmallow> parts of it at least
17:24:43 <medos> The Leica one?
17:24:59 <medos> whoops fuji
17:25:33 <marshmallow> http://vector.tutsplus.com/tutorials/illustration/create-an-aperture-style-camera-lens-icon/
17:25:37 <marshmallow> ^^ it's a good start
17:27:51 <medos> Looks painful
17:30:25 <medos> A looooot of steps. :P
17:35:35 <CottonBalls> Yeah, the trick is to finding a style and then applying it to all of the various icons.
17:35:46 <CottonBalls> I don't know if I am going to make more than the icons I use to start with.
17:36:01 <CottonBalls> I don't have the phone yet either, and that would help to have.
17:36:07 <CottonBalls> It should be here around Wednesday.
17:36:16 <CottonBalls> Regular work is getting in the way of my projects :P
17:37:35 <medos> Make a camera icon!
17:37:37 <medos> Stat!
17:37:44 <medos> Mandatory.
17:37:48 <medos> I'm workin on it too.
17:37:59 <medos> Your choice though. ;)
17:39:40 <marshmallow> i do wanna make it into a camera icon
17:39:49 <marshmallow> yea, there's a lot of steps, but they're very straight forward
17:39:50 <CottonBalls> I will work on it when I get home tonight.
17:40:01 <CottonBalls> But again, I haven't settled on a style yet.
17:40:16 <CottonBalls> I am trying to blend cyberpunk + Deus Ex 
17:41:20 <CottonBalls> I also need to illustrate a anniversary card for my GF at some point before Friday.
17:43:33 <medos> Sounds like a lot of planning.
17:43:36 <medos> :P
17:43:53 <medos> marshmallow i hope you'll add some reflections to the lens!
17:44:24 <marshmallow> hokay
17:45:09 <CottonBalls> It is a lot of planning because I tend to do a 180 on what I like about something in a project half way through.
17:45:21 <CottonBalls> Which is why my website went through 5+ different designs in 6 months.
17:51:40 <medos> D:
17:53:17 <CottonBalls> D: Is right.
17:53:21 <CottonBalls> So many changes.
17:53:49 <CottonBalls> I would finish and see something else on another site and say "Wow, that is neat, I want to do that".
17:54:45 <medos> How about a camera icon!
17:57:15 <medos> Serious note: I took the finished image from that tutorial to add some color to the lens.
18:03:45 <medos> done!
18:04:00 <medos> CottonBalls why would you change your website every few weeks?
18:04:16 <CottonBalls> I always wanted to try something different.
18:06:03 <medos> Sounds like you should make your website work like csszengarden. ;)
18:07:18 <CottonBalls> Hah, yeah maybe.
18:07:25 <CottonBalls> I have since put that energy into other things.
18:07:27 <CottonBalls> Like my job.

23:26:59 <AmandaS4ys> howdy
23:27:08 <Kocho> hey
23:28:23 <TheWhisper> kocho
23:28:30 <TheWhisper> Have you used a logitech g700?
23:28:49 <Kocho> no
23:28:52 <Kocho> but it looks nice
23:28:53 <AmandaS4ys> so... question for all who have experience... how would you develop an smart phone app?
23:29:11 <Kocho> mines a similar shape - it would be mega comfortable
23:29:12 <AmandaS4ys> not graphically but from concept to being sold on the app store
23:30:25 <Kocho> if you rest your wrist and let your fingers rest like it would if a mouse is there, thats what that shape is like
23:30:27 <Kocho> its very good
23:30:45 <thearrowflies> AmandaS4ys: 
23:30:49 <thearrowflies> do you know how to program?
23:31:09 <thearrowflies> also, what platform? ios? android?
23:31:18 <TheWhisper> lol kocho, that's very unspecific
23:31:23 <TheWhisper> but I was in the store looking at it today
23:31:26 <TheWhisper> and it looked pretty sick
23:31:28 <Kocho> yeah
23:31:36 <TheWhisper> the packaging was molded to it
23:31:36 <Kocho> definitely get a nice logitech one
23:31:39 <Kocho> you can't go wrong
23:31:40 <AmandaS4ys> in this case it would be for android
23:31:41 <TheWhisper> so I could pu my hand around it and see it
23:31:43 <TheWhisper> and it felt nice
23:31:46 <Kocho> yeah
23:31:48 <TheWhisper> though they wouldn't take it out of the box
23:31:48 <thearrowflies> Do you konw java?
23:31:48 <AmandaS4ys> but im not literally making it
23:31:51 <TheWhisper> to let me press the buttons
23:31:51 <thearrowflies> oh
23:31:53 <TheWhisper> which pissed me off
23:31:57 <Kocho> ugh
23:32:07 <AmandaS4ys> the deal is, i need to develop the concept of an anti-smoking iphone app
23:32:08 <Kocho> yeah, they keep them all in the packets so people don't take them
23:32:26 <thearrowflies> i thought you said android?
23:32:35 <AmandaS4ys> youre right i'm a derp
23:32:40 <AmandaS4ys> *android
23:32:42 <Kocho> G700 looks to have too many buttons for my liking
23:32:44 <Kocho> lol
23:32:53 <thearrowflies> the concept? just take the new australian cigarrette pack pictures and put them in there
23:32:55 <Kocho> but they're placed where mine are placed, so i'd still be happy with it
23:32:56 <thearrowflies> bam job done
23:33:02 <AmandaS4ys> lolol
23:33:04 <AmandaS4ys> trueeee
23:33:31 <AmandaS4ys> but its for a concept development class and i have to write up a production scheduke
23:33:32 <TheWhisper> yeah
23:33:37 <Kocho> mines wireless and it lasts such a long time
23:33:37 <AmandaS4ys> *schedule, even
23:33:38 <TheWhisper> the button placement felt really nice
23:33:41 <TheWhisper> from what I could tell
23:33:50 <thearrowflies> its basically:
23:33:52 <TheWhisper> the reviews say the wireless battery life for the g700 is pretty bad
23:33:56 <TheWhisper> but it's a wireless/wired mouse
23:33:57 <Kocho> oh ok
23:34:01 <TheWhisper> so if the lights start blinking
23:34:05 <TheWhisper> you just plug the cord in
23:34:07 <TheWhisper> and it charges
23:34:09 <Kocho> ugh
23:34:11 <TheWhisper> no delays
23:34:12 <TheWhisper> or anything
23:34:18 <Kocho> is that how it charges all the time?
23:34:21 <Kocho> does it have a dock?
23:34:23 <TheWhisper> and you can even leave it plugged in if you want
23:34:24 <TheWhisper> uh
23:34:24 <thearrowflies> come up wiht idea, make up a design, code it, make sure it works, send it in to google play store if they approve it your in
23:34:27 <TheWhisper> don't think so
23:34:34 <thearrowflies> if not, you need to fix whatever they tell you to fix
23:34:56 <AmandaS4ys> so would it be feasible to include beta testing in that as well?
23:35:00 <thearrowflies> as for a schedule, well that depends on whatever schedule your on
23:35:01 <thearrowflies> yeah
23:35:21 <thearrowflies> lots of apps release betas
23:35:24 <thearrowflies> like swiftkey
23:36:03 <Kocho> mines not even on the logitech site anymore
23:36:10 <AmandaS4ys> true true
23:36:34 <Kocho> it has been out since 2006 though, i think i read
23:36:35 <TheWhisper> lol
23:36:49 <Kocho> does feel that old
23:36:53 <Kocho> and doesn't look that old either
23:38:04 <Kocho> do you take the mouse around with you TheWhisper?
23:38:09 <TheWhisper> uh
23:38:12 <TheWhisper> i mean
23:38:13 <TheWhisper> i use a laptop
23:38:18 <TheWhisper> though i don't ever move my laptop
23:38:20 <TheWhisper> so eh
23:38:24 <TheWhisper> not really lolol
23:38:27 <Kocho> oh ok
23:38:33 <Kocho> 'cause if you drop mine
23:38:40 <Kocho> its quite fragile
23:38:54 <Kocho> and i'd imagine that g700 or whatever is similar
23:39:09 <TheWhisper> WHOA
23:39:09 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3mgB8gblto
23:39:10 <TheWhisper> that
23:39:13 <TheWhisper> looks awesome
23:39:17 <TheWhisper> I bet medos would love that
23:39:22 <TheWhisper> drawing straight lines made ez
23:40:04 <Kocho> they still don't look that straight
23:40:10 <Kocho> but it looks good
23:40:19 <TheWhisper> ahhh
23:40:19 <TheWhisper> hahaha

23:46:49 <TheWhisper> whoa
23:46:54 <TheWhisper> new ms pages
23:46:56 <TheWhisper> are interesting
23:47:34 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/KM3Zi.png
23:49:31 <TheWhisper> also kocho
23:49:36 <TheWhisper> the thing about the g700 
23:49:46 <TheWhisper> is the rechargable battery it uses is a generic sanyo one
23:49:53 <TheWhisper> instead of a proprietary one
23:50:04 <TheWhisper> so i could also like but a second battery + a sanyo charging dock
23:50:07 <TheWhisper> to just easily switch in and out
23:50:26 <Kocho> i leave mine in the dock overnight
23:50:40 <Kocho> and i'll be able to use my mouse every day for at least 2weeks
23:50:48 <Kocho> overnight once every two weeks
23:51:32 <TheWhisper> nice
