00:01:04 <medos> good question
00:01:06 <medos> good answer
00:01:10 <medos> =)
00:06:37 <TheWhisper> What is pocket?
00:06:41 <TheWhisper> That link just takes me to a read thing
00:06:43 <TheWhisper> I mea
00:06:45 <TheWhisper> mean
00:06:46 <TheWhisper> A register thing
00:08:07 <TheWhisper> oooh
00:08:08 <TheWhisper> cute
00:13:38 <TheWhisper> Pocket's page reformatting is not good though
00:14:02 <TheWhisper> Readability's is much better
00:20:42 <TheWhisper> "I'm not by any means an expert on it, but my impression is that being creative is just a combination of getting new stimulus, but also having periods where you're not getting any stimulus. I had to stop reading Reddit sometime a few years ago, because I found that whenever I'd bump into a problem that was going to take a little time to solve, I'd just switch over and refresh Reddit and distract myself."
00:27:58 <EDSGD> oh
00:27:59 <EDSGD> medos
00:28:07 <EDSGD> regarding the typeface folder
00:28:17 <medos> yeah
00:28:20 <medos> it should still be there
00:28:22 <EDSGD> I think I mentioned this before
00:28:28 <medos> what?
00:28:35 <EDSGD> I have all the google web fonts
00:28:44 <EDSGD> should I toss them in there
00:28:46 <EDSGD> ????
00:29:12 <medos> oh
00:29:17 <medos> organized?
00:29:25 <medos> or just a huge folder with random ttf otf and so on files ?
00:29:41 <medos> like: is there a grouping by serif/sans serif/script
00:29:45 <medos> or by font name
00:29:47 <medos> or family
00:29:49 <EDSGD> nope.

00:31:12 <medos> i have left the folder for now as i needed space in mah dropbox
00:31:24 <medos> how big is the whole thing?
00:31:41 <medos> or rather: when did you get them?
00:32:09 <medos> because google webfonts are getting updated regularly
00:32:15 <EDSGD> I got them last week.
00:32:58 <EDSGD> 831 MB (871,985,152 bytes)
00:34:32 <medos> lol
00:34:39 <medos> do you even have enough space for that ?
00:34:48 <EDSGD> No.

00:37:10 <EDSGD> Hmm how did I end up with 800MB
00:37:35 <EDSGD> 10,784 Files, 1,115 Folders
00:37:59 <medos> 551 folders in that file
00:38:34 <medos> organized by
00:38:41 <medos> Font name
00:38:47 <EDSGD> So is mine.
00:39:34 <medos> weird
00:39:45 <medos> this looks like it's only .ttf
00:42:28 <medos> do you have ttf and otf files for each?
00:42:30 <medos> or specimen?
00:43:53 <medos> OH
00:44:20 <medos> you might have all webfonts, not just the ones currently available
00:44:28 <medos> some went commercial after a while
00:45:10 <EDSGD> ttf only
00:45:20 <EDSGD> and probably 
00:47:24 <TheWhisper> Mozilla Persona
00:47:29 <TheWhisper> sounds insecure
00:47:37 <TheWhisper> "It works like this: pick an e-mail address and a password to use across Persona. Mozilla will e-mail you at that address to verify that it's really yours. Then, any time you encounter a site that supports Persona (the Times Crossword is one early adopter), you can sign in using that single e-mail and password combination.  "
00:47:52 <TheWhisper> Someone hacks their db
00:48:00 <TheWhisper> instant access to tons of accounts
00:48:20 <medos> go read a book on aes 256 hashed encryption
00:48:54 <TheWhisper> Is that what they're using?
00:49:02 <TheWhisper> All I see is "it's encrypted"

00:49:53 <TheWhisper> "Your password is transferred to Mozilla using SSL encryption but is only retained by Mozilla's servers in a hash format (which means a low level of encryption is applied)."
00:49:59 <medos> museo (slab) was part of google webfonts as far as i remember
00:51:00 <EDSGD> apparently not.
00:51:17 <TheWhisper> I have museo

00:51:19 <TheWhisper> not webfont though

02:20:06 <EDSGD> What do you mean "both".
02:20:07 <EDSGD> ?

03:53:19 <medos> i think there's a law in Germany for reduced price depending on time a train runs late
03:53:28 <medos> public transportation is 100% on time
03:53:31 <medos> or 99%
03:54:06 <medos> i'm not sure how it is in the states
03:54:11 <medos> there's usually a system where
03:54:31 <medos> a bus runs late to the train station
03:54:40 <medos> the train waits for passengers
03:55:06 <EDSGD> Its shit man. At least in LA as far as I know.
03:55:33 <EDSGD> A few weeks ago it took me 3hrs to get to work.
03:55:49 <EDSGD> A few months ago it took me 5 hours :(
03:55:58 <medos> it's a lot more connected here i think, if one bus runs late, all other bus drivers in the system adapt to this and wait longer at stops to even this out
03:56:49 <EDSGD> They try to do this here, but it isn't great.
03:57:13 <EDSGD> There's a usual 10- 15 min wait.
03:57:36 <medos> there's a buffer just for this
03:57:42 <EDSGD> When one starts getting ahead of itself it turn to 30 min ones.

04:32:47 <TheWhisper> or indesign
04:32:47 <TheWhisper> or fireworks
04:33:38 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/yO3mC.png
04:33:39 <medos> nope
04:33:39 <TheWhisper> medos http://i.imgur.com/TwY2o.png
04:33:50 <medos> ok
04:33:58 <medos> now how do you do it with only one
04:33:59 <medos> or two
04:34:02 <medos> or three corners?
04:34:27 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/8Y8YS.png
04:34:29 <TheWhisper> that way
04:34:32 <EDSGD> I don't know.
04:34:34 <TheWhisper> because the points are all there 
04:34:36 <TheWhisper> and all editable
04:34:42 <EDSGD> I just delete the points
04:34:46 <medos> lol
04:34:56 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/Jgp2h.png
04:35:08 <EDSGD> Feels to me that it will take the same amount of time.
04:35:45 <TheWhisper> Am I confused? Is that not exactly what he was modelling in his image?
04:35:45 <EDSGD> IDK
04:35:45 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/IEjNt.png
04:35:47 <medos> nope, he wants flexible
04:35:49 <medos> adjustable
04:35:54 <medos> unique for each corner
04:35:56 <medos> boxes
04:35:58 <medos> which exist
04:36:02 <medos> but the guy is a tard
04:36:31 <TheWhisper> what
04:36:39 <TheWhisper> What do you mean/
04:36:44 <EDSGD> Tell him. It will be a bit difficult though if he was born in the 90's
04:36:45 <medos> i want to adjust the corner
04:36:46 <TheWhisper> I don't think I get what he wants then
04:36:47 <medos> radius
04:36:49 <medos> of a corner
04:36:50 <TheWhisper> yes
04:37:02 <medos> not all 4 of them
04:37:07 <TheWhisper> ah
04:37:07 <TheWhisper> I see
04:37:11 <TheWhisper> he wants to just be able to click a point
04:37:14 <TheWhisper> and round that one solely
04:37:52 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/NXfCB.png
04:38:02 <medos> it's ai so smartobjecting to ps is obvious
04:38:29 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/dgLON.png
04:38:33 <TheWhisper> http://bjango.com/articles/roundrect/
04:38:46 <TheWhisper> ...
04:38:52 <TheWhisper> isn't that exactly what I said?
04:38:55 <TheWhisper> ai to ps
04:39:01 <TheWhisper> <@TheWhisper> make it in AI
04:39:37 <medos> buddy
04:39:37 <TheWhisper> oh
04:39:37 <TheWhisper> wait
04:39:37 <TheWhisper> nvm
04:39:37 <medos> i'm asking you how to retain a rounded corner
04:39:37 <TheWhisper> ?
04:39:37 <medos> in a way that you can say "hey this is going to be 10px rounded now"
04:39:37 <TheWhisper> without distortion when resizing?
04:39:46 <medos> and then say "nay now it's going to be 20 and the bottom left is not rounded"
04:39:50 <medos> and the top right
04:39:52 <medos> and what have you
04:39:55 <TheWhisper> hm
04:39:56 <medos> flexible
04:40:03 <TheWhisper> And this is in photoshop?
04:40:06 <TheWhisper> that you're saying this exists?
04:40:32 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/hB7lp.png
04:40:39 <medos> well it's an ai smartobject in ps
04:40:55 <medos> but that's even easier than painfully copy pasting bullshit
04:41:10 <TheWhisper> uh
04:41:16 <TheWhisper> I'm missing something
04:41:33 <TheWhisper> You're saying make it in ai then put it in PS as a smart object?
04:41:52 <medos> you never make buttons
04:42:00 <medos> so you can't appreciate the help this would be
04:42:01 <medos> ;)
04:42:08 <TheWhisper> ...
04:42:12 <TheWhisper> I just said
04:42:15 <TheWhisper> like a hundred times
04:42:17 <TheWhisper> make it in ai
04:42:22 <medos> gimme your file
04:42:23 <TheWhisper> then copy it to PS
04:42:25 <medos> where you have a shape
04:42:25 <TheWhisper> as a smart object
04:42:31 <medos> where i can adjust corners
04:42:33 <medos> with a box
04:42:42 <medos> not (!) by vector
04:42:44 <medos> point dragging
04:42:44 <TheWhisper> oh
04:42:46 <TheWhisper> okay
04:42:47 <TheWhisper> so 
04:42:53 <TheWhisper> then /not/ a smart object
04:43:21 <medos> nevermind
04:43:37 <medos> zakmac did i explain myself well enough for this to make sense?
04:43:43 <TheWhisper> I don't think so
04:44:58 <medos> yeah nevermind
04:44:59 <medos> really
04:45:41 <TheWhisper> edsgd
04:45:45 <TheWhisper> do you know what he's saying
04:45:48 <EDSGD> yes.
04:45:56 <TheWhisper> :(
04:46:05 <TheWhisper> Okay so wait
04:46:14 <medos> the important part here is:
04:46:17 <medos> i can always at any time
04:46:29 <EDSGD> I'm not going to read that.
04:46:36 <TheWhisper> You're saying: There is a way to do what this guy wants in Photoshop, without using copy/pasted shapes from any other program.
04:46:44 <TheWhisper> ^ Is that true?
04:46:47 <medos> adjust any rounded corner
04:46:58 <medos> i give up
04:47:00 <medos> seriously
04:47:06 <medos> can you do this in ai?
04:47:44 <TheWhisper> Select single points and enter a value?
04:47:44 <TheWhisper> Not as far as I know
04:47:44 <medos> wrong
04:47:44 <medos> thank you
04:48:01 <TheWhisper> hm
04:48:02 <TheWhisper> wait
04:48:12 <TheWhisper> hm
04:49:00 <TheWhisper> Lemme see if I can figure it out
04:49:00 <zakmac> medos: Are you telling him to include a .ai file and modify it outside of PS?
04:49:05 <zakmac> Or paste as shape instead of a smart object?
04:49:13 <zakmac> To be honest I didn't read too far up
04:49:49 <TheWhisper> ^ that's what I have no idea
04:49:49 <zakmac> ^ That's what is not a complete sentence?
04:49:50 <TheWhisper> lol
04:50:07 <zakmac> Sorry if I'm being a jerk, htmling my face off over here
04:50:19 <TheWhisper> Medos is the jerky one ;)
04:50:43 <medos> no i just wanted to know if you could solve that problem the guy has
04:50:45 * zakmac mutters "Eurotrash..."
04:50:49 <medos> yeah
04:50:52 <medos> htmldesigner
04:51:16 <zakmac> Hey I got no feedback all friggin' day on a project I could have used unbiased eyes on
04:51:31 <zakmac> Trash talk is totally allowed under these circumstances
04:51:49 <medos> i said the qr code looks too detailed
04:52:09 <medos> the gradient on each button looked weird
04:52:11 <medos> like
04:52:12 <zakmac> How do you dumb down a QR even more without making it look like two square blocks
04:52:18 <TheWhisper> I feel like the answer is going to somehow be strokes
04:54:01 <medos> and there was no content
04:54:12 <medos> zakmac where was the hover state?
04:54:23 <zakmac> I worked on it all day btu gave up on feedback. Its got content 
04:54:32 <TheWhisper> hm
04:54:49 <medos> for those buttons on top :p
04:55:18 <medos> i would've pointed horrible stuff out
04:55:22 <EDSGD> Guys. Do you think these two fonts go along with each other? http://i.imgur.com/YVHFy.png
04:55:22 <medos> like the QR code monster
04:55:32 <EDSGD> mind the black 
04:55:42 <zakmac> !votesyesofcourse
04:56:04 <zakmac> I'd like to see lowercase on the header though to know for sure
04:56:12 <EDSGD> k.
04:56:49 <EDSGD> zakmac here  you go. http://i.imgur.com/dvdzA.png
04:57:11 <medos> yo
04:57:17 <medos> what's with your aliasing settings again D:
04:57:24 <EDSGD> crisp.
04:57:33 <EDSGD> There's black on it btw 
04:57:34 <medos> good
04:57:50 <EDSGD> do you think these two fonts work medos
04:58:26 <medos> is it for a website?
04:58:34 <EDSGD> Kind of.
04:58:37 <medos> is it going to be a google webfont being rendered?
04:58:41 <EDSGD> no. 
04:58:44 <medos> good
04:58:48 <medos> heh
04:58:53 <medos> works
04:58:54 <medos> <3
04:58:59 <EDSGD> YAY
04:59:06 <EDSGD> I mean Hooray! 
05:02:19 <TheWhisper> hm
05:02:21 <TheWhisper> medos
05:02:23 <TheWhisper> I did this:
05:02:31 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/PxZ8Q.png
05:02:36 <TheWhisper> is that it?
05:02:48 <TheWhisper> hm
05:03:01 <TheWhisper> That allows me to change the corner radii
05:03:07 <TheWhisper> but not the radius of an individual corner
05:03:09 <TheWhisper> hm
05:03:16 <medos> i'd like to only have the lower right corner
05:03:18 <medos> rounded
05:03:25 <medos> thank you
05:03:34 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:03:36 <TheWhisper> still looking
05:03:55 <medos> and if i later decide differently i'd like to have the top left rounded too and the bottom left rounded 2 px less
05:03:58 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:04:18 <medos> not by dragging and removing vector points
05:04:28 <medos> reversable
05:04:30 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:04:32 <TheWhisper> i know
05:04:37 <medos> feel free to make a ctrl+z joke
05:04:38 <medos> herpderp
05:04:41 <zakmac> Eh, they kinda match
05:04:42 <TheWhisper> the rounded rectangle in the appearance panel is reversible
05:04:46 <TheWhisper> just not individually
05:04:48 <zakmac> Not really though
05:04:51 <TheWhisper> so still looking
05:05:11 <TheWhisper> Medos is this thing you're talking about in ps or ai
05:06:31 <medos> ai
05:06:55 <TheWhisper> hm
05:06:56 <medos> because a shape pasted from ai to ps as smart object can be adjusted and re-saved
05:07:01 <TheWhisper> okay
05:07:02 <TheWhisper> so
05:07:04 <TheWhisper> that's what i said
05:07:11 <medos> so if i change the shape (e.g.: set rounded corner to 10px)
05:07:13 <TheWhisper> yes
05:07:17 <TheWhisper> that's what i said
05:07:17 <medos> it'll translate to photoshop
05:07:19 <medos> yeah
05:07:21 <TheWhisper> so
05:07:26 <medos> and if i later decide differently i'd like to have the top left rounded too and the bottom left rounded 2 px less
05:07:31 <medos> with the same shape
05:07:41 <medos> not a new shape
05:07:43 <TheWhisper> I just don't know how to do the individual corners
05:07:44 <medos> not ctrl+z
05:07:47 <TheWhisper> but the rest was what i said
05:07:53 <medos> yeah
05:08:01 <TheWhisper> ...
05:08:07 <medos> just not knowing the essential part of this trick
05:08:10 <medos> is not helpful
05:08:12 <medos> derpderp
05:08:19 <TheWhisper> Well yeah
05:08:30 <TheWhisper> But when I was saying "do you mean pasting in as a smart object"
05:08:34 <TheWhisper> saying "no i give up"
05:08:48 <TheWhisper> is different than "somewhat. that's part of it, but there's another step too"
05:08:58 <medos> i don't know feel free to try more
05:09:52 <TheWhisper> ...
05:10:29 <medos> http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44398/screenshots/720277/attachments/67886/full.png
05:11:15 <TheWhisper> yes
05:11:18 <TheWhisper> I know what he wants to do
05:12:48 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/lLmag.png
05:13:16 <TheWhisper> hm
05:17:07 <medos> the reason .ai is fine is because a smartobject behaves just like a shape, so whenever he opens the shape to add or remove or adjust a rounded corner
05:17:10 <medos> it'll be the same shape
05:17:16 <medos> not misaligning
05:17:20 <medos> not jumping anywhere
05:17:31 <medos> it'll just update as soon as it's saved in ai
05:17:50 <medos> photoshop will instantly update the shape
05:17:51 <TheWhisper> i know that
05:18:13 <TheWhisper> I know about using and editing smart objects
05:23:05 <TheWhisper> I dunno how to do it
05:24:32 <EDSGD> that editing smart objects are really annoying but useful
05:24:36 <EDSGD> at least to me. 
05:25:02 <TheWhisper> what?
05:25:51 <TheWhisper> http://park12.wakwak.com/~shp/lc/et/en_aics_script.html#roundany lol
05:25:52 <TheWhisper> found that
05:26:14 <medos> reversible?
05:28:42 <TheWhisper> http://theitbros.com/adobe-illustrator-cs5-round-one-corner this seems to be
05:29:19 <medos> not using a plugin btw
05:29:21 <medos> or script
05:31:27 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/TKDah.png
05:31:35 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/TsOR5.png lol
05:31:52 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/mIwvK.png
05:31:54 <TheWhisper> :P
05:32:46 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/QkUn7.png
05:33:37 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I was kidding with mine lol
05:33:54 <medos> at least you're trying
05:33:55 <medos> lelele
05:33:57 <TheWhisper> lol
05:34:05 <TheWhisper> did you start with a rounded rect or a normal one?
05:34:15 <EDSGD> i.imgur.com/aaigY.jpg
05:36:51 <TheWhisper> Medos
05:37:03 <TheWhisper> you need to share this technique with the world
05:37:42 <medos> i will
05:37:48 <medos> and you'll say it's retarded
05:38:08 <TheWhisper> As long as it works :P
05:38:41 <TheWhisper> hm
05:38:55 <TheWhisper> wait
05:39:23 <TheWhisper> can i like
05:39:25 <TheWhisper> shrink a fill
05:40:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/lx6TJ.png
05:40:57 <TheWhisper> lol
05:41:54 <TheWhisper> yayyyy
05:42:11 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/2COrZ.png
05:42:12 <TheWhisper> ^
05:42:13 <TheWhisper> ^
05:42:14 <TheWhisper> ????
05:42:18 <TheWhisper> profit!
05:42:37 <TheWhisper> that is it, right?
05:43:04 <medos> yup
05:43:15 <TheWhisper> also, it's really annoying to use the transform sliders, instead of being able to drag points with the mouse to transform a fill :(
05:43:26 <TheWhisper> fuck yeah
05:43:54 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/jW2bC.png
05:44:07 <TheWhisper> ooh
05:44:14 <TheWhisper> so that's like
05:44:24 <TheWhisper> 4 fills that are cubes
05:44:28 <TheWhisper> *squares
05:44:34 <TheWhisper> and then
05:44:45 <TheWhisper> hm
05:44:57 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/J1lFo.png
05:45:06 <TheWhisper> oh
05:45:07 <medos> it's like
05:45:08 <TheWhisper> ooooh
05:45:10 <medos> an universal button
05:45:14 <medos> you have this one button
05:45:20 <medos> and you can round it however you want
05:45:24 <TheWhisper> yessss
05:45:25 <TheWhisper> I see
05:45:25 <medos> the funniest part about this is
05:45:30 <TheWhisper> so wait though
05:45:33 <medos> that when you dublicate a smartobject
05:45:37 <medos> in photoshop
05:45:45 <TheWhisper> how does that keep shape if you drag out one edge or something?
05:45:45 <medos> it retains one and the same shape
05:45:59 <medos> it's about buttons, not mutants
05:46:10 <medos> you could do pretty much anything precisely by using the transform panel
05:47:36 <TheWhisper> oh
05:47:38 <TheWhisper> I'm blind
05:47:45 <TheWhisper> I didn't realize you hid two of the fills
05:47:45 <TheWhisper> lol
05:47:50 <TheWhisper> so I was still really confused :P
05:48:13 <medos> it's always 50% of the entire shape
05:48:16 <medos> if you resize the button
05:48:30 <medos> the fills in each corner will still be 50% of it
05:48:57 <medos> if you want to round so much that you go over 50% of the shape with your corner
05:49:06 <medos> you just deactivate another corner
05:49:09 <medos> yadayada and so on
05:49:37 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/zsdAD.png yay
05:49:41 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:50:10 <TheWhisper> Is there a reason you have both round corners and round rectangle on?
05:50:32 <medos> nah
05:50:38 <medos> not really
05:50:42 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/herpingderping.psd
05:51:30 <medos> open one of the lower four smartobjects
05:51:33 <TheWhisper> ugh
05:51:36 <TheWhisper> that sounds tough
05:51:36 <medos> and adjust the rounded corner
05:51:54 <medos> or anything
05:51:56 <medos> and resave
05:52:27 <TheWhisper> is that different than
05:52:33 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/vjPdb.png
05:52:44 <TheWhisper> are you trying to show me that resaving it updates alll of them?
05:52:50 <TheWhisper> because I do know how that works
05:52:56 <medos> yeah
05:53:02 <medos> no complaints
05:53:17 <TheWhisper> also
05:53:22 <TheWhisper> cs6 opens super fast
05:54:44 <TheWhisper> How come you can't round more than 30 px?
05:55:25 <TheWhisper> cool things i knew already: http://i.imgur.com/jVw0V.png
05:55:29 <medos> 90 degrees
05:55:31 <TheWhisper> i.e. smart objects = linked files
05:55:39 <TheWhisper> 90 degrees is
05:55:42 <TheWhisper> a corner
05:55:43 <TheWhisper> yes
05:56:23 <TheWhisper> I feel like this is going to be a really basic geometry thing
05:56:23 <TheWhisper> like
05:56:28 <TheWhisper> any more than 30
05:56:32 <TheWhisper> will end up with a
05:56:37 <TheWhisper> concave corner
05:56:39 <TheWhisper> instead of convex
05:56:49 <medos> euh
05:56:50 <medos> no
05:56:58 <medos> it's a rounded rectangle
05:57:05 <medos> not a circle
05:57:21 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/qRxVn.png
05:57:32 <medos> catch mah drift?
05:57:36 <TheWhisper> how did you get 89
05:57:46 <TheWhisper> oh
05:57:46 <medos> by rounding corners
05:57:47 <TheWhisper> oooooh
05:57:48 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:57:49 <TheWhisper> i see
05:57:49 <TheWhisper> duh
05:57:54 <TheWhisper> cool
05:58:19 <TheWhisper> so it's just like
05:58:25 <TheWhisper> sort of arbitrary of them then
05:58:30 <TheWhisper> they could have made it allowable
05:58:36 <TheWhisper> but they wanted to stick to the exact name of the tool
05:58:37 <TheWhisper> i see
05:59:08 <medos> it goes by corner
05:59:10 <TheWhisper> so anyway
05:59:13 <TheWhisper> yeah
05:59:14 <medos> not bad
05:59:23 <TheWhisper> are you going to post that
05:59:30 <medos> imma rebound
05:59:52 <medos> with a video link
05:59:54 <TheWhisper> also is there a preference to have previews on by default
05:59:56 <medos> to make it less derpy
05:59:56 <TheWhisper> actually
06:00:00 <TheWhisper> no i don't want them on by default
06:00:00 <TheWhisper> nvm
06:00:47 <medos> previews?
06:00:53 <medos> of what?
06:00:58 <TheWhisper> tools
06:01:00 <TheWhisper> and stuff
06:01:27 <EDSGD> Oh noes.
06:01:37 <EDSGD> Photoshop crashed while saving.

19:15:48 <internetpolice> download some shittier music
19:15:51 <internetpolice> and blast baq
19:22:43 <TheWhisper> Or use their wireless printers

23:46:50 <R0tt3n> like its slanted but they didnt just transform rotate it
23:46:56 <Matt3000> R0tt3n,   the wood,text,
23:46:58 <Matt3000> oh text?
23:47:04 <Matt3000> it could be a font

23:48:28 <Matt3000> R0tt3n, im going to see if i can replicate it
23:48:36 <Matt3000> it might be a simple slant though it doesnt look like it
23:48:43 <R0tt3n> but yeah, any ideas on how he got it slanted? cause transforming it doesnt work, the type warp options dont work
