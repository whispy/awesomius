03:31:58 <marshmallow> but that character is really popular.  I'm sure you know
03:32:15 <edodes> garfield was the name I couldn't remember
03:32:24 <marshmallow> yup.  fat kitty
03:32:24 <edodes> I was thinking goldfish sor some reason
03:32:39 <edodes> s/sor/for
03:32:44 <marshmallow> lol
03:32:54 <marshmallow> too much excitement XD
03:32:57 <edodes> :D

03:34:05 <marshmallow> ZOMGOSH
03:34:07 <marshmallow> you're good
03:34:08 <marshmallow> XD
03:34:34 <edodes> no idea :(
03:34:43 <marshmallow> cartoon
03:34:47 <edodes> if it turns out I know this character I'm going to cry
03:34:58 <marshmallow> you probably know
03:35:08 <marshmallow> very famous cartoon
03:35:20 <marshmallow> from a movie
03:35:37 <edodes> all I can think of is wiley the coyote :/
03:35:43 <marshmallow> lol
03:35:49 <marshmallow> i considered doing him
03:35:58 <edodes> you should have!
03:36:01 <edodes> and road runner
03:36:06 <marshmallow> i got tired -.-
03:36:18 <marshmallow> they're fast to make, but boring after the first 5ish
03:36:19 <marshmallow> lol
03:36:24 <edodes> I'll send you a 5 hour energy
03:36:25 <edodes> heh
03:36:29 <marshmallow> lol
03:36:44 <edodes> still have no clue, going to need another hint
03:37:01 <marshmallow> this movie is a trilogy
03:37:22 <edodes> see now I'm thinking pokemon :/
03:37:55 <edodes> all I see is a somewhat muscley looking elbow/arm
03:38:01 <edodes> and either a tail or a weird deformity
03:38:07 <edodes> or a cow hoof
03:38:08 <edodes> xD
03:38:23 <marshmallow> lol
03:38:28 <marshmallow> it was also the first one i made
03:38:38 <marshmallow> so i didn't really get the technique good for it
03:38:54 <marshmallow> the 3rd movie came out i think a year or two ago
03:38:58 <marshmallow> it was a pretty popular hit
03:39:33 <zakmac> Think I'm gonna be lazy and write a php/js script to just curl the EPA's website and rip whatever info they display publicly rather than format 34 years of data
03:40:05 <zakmac> I'll miss out on tons of awesome stuff that they have for some cars but this is insane
03:40:27 <marshmallow>  http://imgur.com/a/pLcWk <-- zakmac =D
03:40:41 <marshmallow> ^^made them today
03:40:44 <edodes> zakmac, http://i.imgur.com/Xu3Vt.jpg WHO IS IT!?!?!?

03:42:52 <edodes> kirby!

03:42:55 <Kocho> than woody
03:43:00 <edodes> woody?
03:43:04 <edodes> how the hell is that woody
03:43:07 <zakmac> Psh, if you played SSB maybe
03:43:26 * marshmallow <3 SSB
03:43:32 <Kocho> wait
03:43:36 <Kocho> who's the first one?

03:43:40 <Kocho> http://i.imgur.com/Xu3Vt.jpg
03:43:45 <edodes> tweety
03:43:51 <edodes> o
03:43:52 <edodes> woody
03:43:55 <Kocho> ..
03:43:56 <edodes> apparently
03:44:00 <edodes> I don't see it
03:44:04 <Kocho> hows that woody?
03:44:07 <Kocho> from toy story?
03:44:08 <edodes> I know!
03:44:12 <edodes> no idea
03:44:13 <zakmac> http://www.binarymoon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/toy-story-3-woody.jpg
03:44:18 <edodes> ask marshmallow
03:44:22 <Kocho> LOL
03:44:27 <marshmallow> yar, that's the one =D
03:44:31 <Kocho> LOLOL
03:44:33 <edodes> ooooooh
03:44:34 <Kocho> thats impossible
03:44:53 <zakmac> You see his scarf tie
03:45:00 <zakmac> And what looks like someone tipping a hat
03:45:01 <edodes> how the hell...
03:45:03 <zakmac> Who else does that?
03:45:06 <edodes> I saw a freaking cow hoof
03:45:12 <edodes> for his scarf
03:45:13 <edodes> xD
03:45:17 <Kocho> i thought it was like some robot crab thing
03:45:19 <edodes> lol
03:45:29 <Kocho> the top right looks lil some sort of shoulder arm
03:45:30 <zakmac> WrobotcrabthingY
03:45:31 <marshmallow> lol
03:45:32 <Kocho> transformer thing
03:45:36 <edodes> yeah
03:45:43 <Kocho> like*
03:45:53 <edodes> guess I got too used to the full body thing
03:46:00 <Kocho> yeah
03:46:06 <Kocho> kirby was easy though
03:46:09 <Kocho> so it balances out
03:46:09 <Kocho> lol
03:46:13 <edodes> xD
03:46:22 <marshmallow> oh, i tried finding a full body but I didn't find a good picture that I liked
03:46:41 <zakmac> marshmallow: it'd be awesome if instead of a name hint you did like the background as woody's shirt texture and the others in a similar fashion like Kirby could be Kirby pink with two blush-looking spots
03:46:49 <Kocho> this is the opposite of bubbling, no?
03:46:51 <Kocho> ;)
03:47:09 <marshmallow> oh, i didn't think that far. XD
03:47:13 <zakmac> Much less magic underpants in marshmallow's version
03:47:22 <Kocho> lol
03:47:23 <marshmallow> i did choose similar colors though
03:47:32 <zakmac> I noticed, $.02
03:47:56 <marshmallow> woot =D
03:48:29 <marshmallow> <@zakmac> Much less magic underpants in marshmallow's version <- LAWLS
03:49:18 <zakmac> Back soon, rewarding my vast knowledge of bubbled-pop-culture characters with some Americone Dream
03:51:02 <edodes> since yall are here...
03:51:09 <edodes> Anyone have any good links/adivce for how to deal with "the money issue" when doing design work for family?
03:51:30 <zakmac> Do you like them?
03:51:59 <edodes> I don't know them that well, but we do interact from time to time.
03:52:11 <edodes> other than that they seem nice
03:52:17 <zakmac> Charge a fair amount, treat it like you're painting their house for them. The tangibility of goods does not dictate their value
03:52:38 <marshmallow> i would cut them a deal
03:52:51 <zakmac> You'll be put out time, effort and resources (skills, hard drive bytes ;)  )
03:52:56 <marshmallow> or if I knew they wanted free work, sometimes I flat out say... not interested
03:53:08 <zakmac>  Boom goes the marshmallow
03:53:25 <marshmallow> lol
03:53:47 <edodes> heh, well all they've asked so far is if I'm will. They said they would pay (when talking to them in person), but they haven't mentioned anything about how much or if they're still willing to pay in my e-mail correspondence with thme
03:53:54 <edodes> willing*
03:54:04 <edodes> them* wow can't type
03:54:07 <Kocho> say that you cut them a deal
03:54:09 <Kocho> but dont
03:54:15 <edodes> I have no idea how to bring it up gracefully
03:54:15 <Kocho> and then work with them like any other client
03:55:10 <edodes> they're the kind of people that have no idea how much a web developer actually costs :/
03:55:20 <Kocho> better for you then
03:55:25 <Kocho> how much does one cost?
03:55:26 <edodes> heh
03:55:28 <Kocho> its tough to say
03:55:54 <marshmallow> oh, you're building them a website?
03:56:18 <edodes> exactly, I don't want to say some obsurd amount, but I don't want to get shafted
03:56:22 <edodes> two actually
03:56:27 <edodes> one for the husband's business
03:56:28 <edodes> one for the wife
03:56:39 <Kocho> just charge what you would for a normal client
03:56:49 <Kocho> but with 20% less
03:56:51 <Kocho> thats what i do
03:56:57 <marshmallow> sounds about right
03:57:05 <Kocho> its still work
03:57:25 <marshmallow> webdesigning is a bitch.  SOOO many people asked me to make sites for them and I flat out refused them since I knew they weren't gonna pay
03:57:27 <Kocho> i always think of it like a house
03:57:28 <edodes> @.@ I don't do this for a living, so no idea what I'd charge :/ I stopped working years ago and have just been doing it as a hobby ever since
03:57:33 <Kocho> ahh
03:57:35 <Kocho> ok
03:57:39 <Kocho> thats a bit different then
03:57:44 <edodes> this is more in the "favor because you're family"
03:57:46 <edodes> kind of deal
03:57:47 <zakmac> http://graphicdesign.about.com/od/career/a/friends_family.htm
03:58:23 <zakmac> Don't bone yourself just to do them a favor. Family and those seeking "a deal" have been some of the worst I've worked with.
03:58:25 <edodes> how the heck did my google search not catch that
03:58:28 <edodes> I suck at using google
03:58:49 <zakmac> Just yesterday I saw a huge project of mine scrapped by a person who I consider a friend and I was doing it 100% pro bono
03:59:32 <edodes> I've got no doubts they'd pay whatever I asked, they're pretty well off, but I see them every few months and would hate for things to be awkward if I asked a lot
03:59:35 <edodes> yikes
03:59:54 <edodes> yeah I never do anything pro bono
04:00:29 <zakmac> http://www.epa.gov/otaq/cert/mpg/testcars/database/testCarListDefinitions.pdf
04:00:40 <zakmac> Aw yeah, figuring these files out just got much easier
04:01:26 <edodes> alright so, learning from my earlier mistakes: I should lay out a flat rate for the entire project, or charge per page? or charge hourly?
04:01:47 <zakmac> Depends on how you work
04:02:31 <edodes> awesome, so any of those would be viable options?
04:02:35 <zakmac> I'm crazy fast so I'm moving to a flat-rate for the project (as strictly defined in advance) with 10% of my quoted delivery time as revisions with $45/hr for revisions past the 10% of total project completion time
04:02:47 <marshmallow> hey zakmac, which car on your list has the best mpg by the way?  I'm in need of a new car eventualy
04:02:54 <marshmallow> *eventually
04:03:10 <zakmac> No idea, heh. I'll let you know once I get them all entered in
04:03:18 <marshmallow> lol, okay
04:03:32 <marshmallow> i won't be needing to buy till the summer though
04:03:34 <zakmac> I know the 198X Dart was something like 50MPG once it was adjusted for new standards
04:03:35 <marshmallow> or next summer
04:03:47 <zakmac> Good, I should finally have a database by then
04:03:59 <marshmallow> yay
04:05:05 <zakmac> http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=32483 (this means there are 32,483 entries I need to put in)
04:05:10 <zakmac> :(
04:05:23 <Kocho> hows it going zak?
04:06:08 <zakmac> Slowly, the government provides the info but between 1984 and 2012 they changed formats many many times and each data set doesn't have standard values beyond mpg make and model
04:06:20 <Kocho> damn
04:06:49 <zakmac> Meh, I'll figure it out. It'll be nice to learn some more PHP and fiddle with these files trying to make as little work as possible :)
04:07:02 <zakmac> I think my weekend project will be entering five years
04:07:42 <marshmallow> ouch
04:08:51 <zakmac> And if it ends up being a decent db I can offer it for sale once its all organized
04:10:35 <EDSGD> Sobering up,

16:01:12 <R0tt3n> oh, I live in Canada eh so I dunno if id be able to go

16:01:33 <marshmallow> canadians have cheaper colleges

16:04:14 <marshmallow> i mean, syracuse is a good school..  but...  it's very pricey
16:04:40 <R0tt3n> true, yeah i dont have a lot of money
16:05:24 <internetpolice> i didn't know that TheWhisper is a richguykid
16:05:27 <internetpolice> lolol
16:05:39 <TheWhisper> syracuse is too expensive :(
16:05:41 <marshmallow> i'm very jaded by the american college system.  In general, all the "top" schools are overvalued and too expensive and not worth it unless if you want to be an engineer, something medical (like doctors/nurses/vets), or accounting
16:05:54 <R0tt3n> so marshmallow, how did you get into the ad scene?
16:05:56 <TheWhisper> I'm very jaded
16:06:01 <TheWhisper> because my lightbulbs are green
16:06:04 <R0tt3n> was it networking?

16:06:25 <marshmallow> I personally hate it though right now
16:06:29 <marshmallow> and timing
16:06:34 <marshmallow> timing is KEY to getting a job
16:06:42 <internetpolice> R0tt3n mind showing the final version of that club flyer you made a few weeks ago?
16:07:17 <R0tt3n> eh sure, but its kinda shitty, could i show you a good one i recently made?
16:07:22 <marshmallow> btw, I speak as somebody who went to one of the top schools in America.  
16:07:32 <marshmallow> so I can bash them a lot =D
16:07:42 <internetpolice> nope i want to see that one
16:07:43 <internetpolice> :p
16:08:13 <R0tt3n> fineee, well take a look at this one while i find the other one

16:09:19 <EDSGD> Hey guys what do you think? http://i.imgur.com/KEelt.png

16:09:46 <R0tt3n> yeah i scrapped that, the client didnt like it
16:09:51 <internetpolice> go figure
16:09:57 <internetpolice> D:
16:10:06 <R0tt3n> i make it look a bit better though
16:10:20 <R0tt3n> but the picture just wasnt easy to work with
16:10:47 <R0tt3n> what do you think of the other ones i posted?
16:11:17 <internetpolice> R0tt3n if you want to do advertising and make a flyer for a club and when i ask you what kind of music that club plays and you say "uhh, club music" that's missing the point of advertising
16:11:26 <internetpolice> i just wanted to see how it turned out tbh :p
16:11:32 <marshmallow> <@EDSGD> Hey guys what do you think? http://i.imgur.com/KEelt.png <- I don't get it
16:11:42 <marshmallow> what are you showing me?
16:11:49 <R0tt3n> ahhh I see
16:11:51 <EDSGD> That^
16:11:54 <internetpolice> no matter what it's about you gotta know what you're doing ;0
16:12:18 <internetpolice> "i want to get into advertising except for clubs that play 80's house funk"
16:12:24 <internetpolice> does not work :P
16:12:27 <EDSGD> Could this rectangular piece of plastic look better? 
16:12:35 <R0tt3n> yeah, I get ya
16:12:35 <EDSGD> Need to work on shadows.
16:13:02 <R0tt3n> well it wasnt like I just want to make posters for that specific genre
16:13:14 <R0tt3n> I just liked the picture
16:13:34 <R0tt3n> lol
16:14:52 <internetpolice> you said you picked it because it looks funny
16:15:08 <internetpolice> what you like doesn't really matter in advertising :p
16:15:15 <internetpolice> /ruinedthedream
16:15:37 <R0tt3n> Nah I get what you're saying and I still want to get into advertising
16:16:43 <R0tt3n> that one poster was just an isolated incident

16:18:42 <R0tt3n> theres a site called clubcrawlers

16:19:44 <TheWhisper> if any of you have anaglyph 3d glasses
16:19:46 <TheWhisper> look at this http://i.imgur.com/a8eQ3.jpg
16:20:33 <R0tt3n> so tell me, how do i figure out what style appeals to 21 year old yuppies?
16:21:41 <internetpolice> not calling them yuppies is a start
16:21:52 <internetpolice> because your client and his clients are not some yuppies
16:22:09 <R0tt3n> well yuppies means younge professional
16:22:26 <R0tt3n> young urban professional*
16:22:42 <R0tt3n> i didnt mean it in the sense of insulting them
16:23:03 <internetpolice> would one of those guys call himself a yuppie?
16:23:31 <TheWhisper> do yuppies eve nexist anymore
16:23:38 <TheWhisper> i thought that was an 80s thing
16:23:48 <R0tt3n> it was, but the word is still around
16:23:59 <R0tt3n> and yeah they'd call themselves yuppies

16:27:55 <R0tt3n> like yeah, google what they/people call themselves and take note of the graphic styles?
16:28:12 <internetpolice> there's no checklist
16:28:30 <internetpolice> and you ignored the most important part about that clubcrawler site
16:28:56 <R0tt3n> the dress code saying no baggy clothes?
16:29:05 <internetpolice> nope
16:29:06 <R0tt3n> yeah that picture would not have worked well at all
16:29:11 <internetpolice> true
16:29:20 <R0tt3n> THE MUSIC!
16:29:50 <internetpolice> CORRECT!
16:30:12 <R0tt3n> but like mash up is so vague 
16:30:22 <internetpolice> now if i remember correctly you said the dj plays "top 40 stuff like ..."
16:31:04 <internetpolice> mash up?
16:31:08 <internetpolice> young adults?
16:31:14 <internetpolice> music sources?

16:31:58 <TheWhisper> it looks cool in 3d
16:32:54 <R0tt3n> True, I guess I didnt really pay attention to the music all that much
16:33:05 <internetpolice> http://i.imgur.com/BQRNK.png
16:33:07 <R0tt3n> which kind of makes me miss my target demo right?
16:34:19 <internetpolice> you took a funny picture and presented it to a trendsetting entrepreneur who runs a club for people in their twenties
16:34:32 <internetpolice> :P
16:34:45 <R0tt3n> LOL
16:34:58 <R0tt3n> to be fair, i didnt show him it
16:35:15 <R0tt3n> i scrapped it before I did that and went with a different approach

17:12:13 <marshmallow> eggs are forbidden in vegan, right?
17:12:35 <zakmac> Your cheesecake killed imgur. It finally loaded though. They look delectable though I'd probably opt for some strawberry shortcake-style strawberries over the cherries (personal pref)
17:13:07 <marshmallow> ya, i was thinking of using strawberries or blueberries for my next batch
17:13:17 <marshmallow> but neither are in season, so.. .we'll see
17:13:17 <zakmac> Haha, yeah cherries are cool its eggs, dairy, or anything that comes from something with a face/mother (though some vegans do honey)

17:50:32 <Sat> If it wasn't for that i wouldnt be as big a deal
17:51:02 <marshmallow> ooh, i didn't notice that
17:51:17 <medos> it's inside of the box so i wouldn't count it as sale-robbing-plagiarism
17:51:20 <marshmallow> i was too busy looking at the people

21:24:55 <r0tt3n> >_>
21:24:55 <TheWhisper> uh
21:25:04 <TheWhisper> The grass is not right
21:25:15 <TheWhisper> It looks like you pasted one grass photo onto another one
21:25:28 <r0tt3n> the grass around the helmet/
21:26:10 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/Qh0SO.jpg
21:26:18 <TheWhisper> The red is one type
21:26:21 <TheWhisper> and the blue a different one
21:26:28 <TheWhisper> or at least that's how it looks to me
21:26:30 <TheWhisper> hm
21:26:35 <r0tt3n> lol, that was the same image
21:26:37 <r0tt3n> haha
21:26:38 <TheWhisper> hm
21:26:40 <TheWhisper> Did you blur it
21:26:44 <TheWhisper> That may be why
21:26:46 <r0tt3n> no

21:26:55 <r0tt3n> it was like that when i found it
21:26:56 <TheWhisper> okay then
21:27:05 <TheWhisper> the text needs a ton of work btw

21:27:17 <shutterxflash> i'm not sure?
21:27:23 <shutterxflash> i just joined reddit
21:27:59 <TheWhisper> the helmet is not bad though
21:27:59 <TheWhisper> try to put
21:27:59 <shutterxflash> so, i'm a little confused on how all of it works
21:27:59 <shutterxflash> i'm looking for a graphic designer though
21:27:59 <shutterxflash> to help edit a logo of mine
21:28:00 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/BjgQ0.png put that behind more grass, r0tt3n
21:28:05 <shutterxflash> modify some type
21:28:10 <shutterxflash> that's it.
21:28:13 <shutterxflash> the logo is already done
21:28:16 <TheWhisper> Let's see the logo :P
21:28:38 <r0tt3n> thanks, what would you suggest doing with the type
21:28:38 <shutterxflash> kk, hold on.
21:28:42 <TheWhisper> uh
21:28:50 <TheWhisper> oh also
21:28:52 <TheWhisper> the lighting
21:28:54 <TheWhisper> needs work
21:29:02 <TheWhisper> medos is better than I with lighting 
21:29:03 <TheWhisper> but
21:29:09 <r0tt3n> needs to be lighter?
21:29:31 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/tnexE.png
21:29:38 <TheWhisper> idk though 
21:29:46 <TheWhisper> just to start
21:29:51 <TheWhisper> but medos can tell you more on that
21:29:58 <r0tt3n> true true
21:30:13 <r0tt3n> so what about the type? take out the drop shadow?

22:05:10 <shutterxflash> client wants the type edited
22:05:23 <shutterxflash> starbursts added, as seen on the earrings over type
22:05:29 <shutterxflash> (selective)
22:05:29 <Sat> the helmet looks to me like it has been lit in a studio, can see the big reflection of the softbox
22:05:45 <Sat> @rott3n
22:05:46 <medos> from a facebook photo?
22:05:47 <shutterxflash> and the edge of the circle widened up a little bit
22:05:53 <shutterxflash> nooo
22:05:53 <shutterxflash> haha
22:05:54 <shutterxflash> lol
22:06:07 <shutterxflash> i have the photoshop file
22:06:14 <shutterxflash> that was just to display it
22:06:30 <TheWhisper> are they single?
22:07:27 <TheWhisper> lol
22:08:30 <Sat> might be nicer if the black womans body dissapeared behind the blue circle
22:11:35 <medos> shutterxflash is your psd vector based?
22:11:43 <medos> e.g.: in how far do you need help?
22:11:56 <medos> Paid job or free advice?
22:16:47 <shutterxflash> paid job
22:16:55 <shutterxflash> erm...would have to look
22:20:22 <medos> well, the most important question is: is the text on a separate layer and easy to remove?
