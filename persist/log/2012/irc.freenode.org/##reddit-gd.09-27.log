00:04:06 <Sat> your implying making that poster wasn't fun?
00:04:27 <medos> no
00:04:41 <medos> i was implying that you should make one yourself instead of buying that
00:04:56 <Sat> touche
00:08:23 <throatvibrations> Sat
00:08:27 <throatvibrations> show us the poster 
00:08:28 <throatvibrations> oh nevermind

00:09:56 <medos> looks surprisingly like something i've seen just a few minutes ago :p
00:10:00 <throatvibrations> ?
00:10:06 <throatvibrations> What?
00:10:49 <Sat> must link to (video you've already seen) this after seeing that http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4c_wI6kQyE
00:12:18 <throatvibrations> lol
00:12:35 <throatvibrations> I feel like it's just really boring though
00:12:49 <throatvibrations> What can I do to make it less boring? 
00:12:57 <throatvibrations> I don't want to make it too intense though
00:13:03 <throatvibrations> as I still want the photos to be the most important
00:13:09 <medos> MAKE IT POP A LITTLE
00:13:10 <throatvibrations> hm
00:13:12 <throatvibrations> subtle textures
00:13:16 <throatvibrations> and light noise?
00:13:25 <medos> stop using designer terms
00:13:29 <throatvibrations> ...
00:13:35 <medos> you should make a mspaint dick pattern for the bg
00:13:53 <Kocho> throatvibrations' work looks a lot like TWs
00:13:56 <throatvibrations> sometimes I want to kill you
00:14:06 <throatvibrations> lol kocho 
00:14:10 <throatvibrations> genius

00:14:32 <throatvibrations> Do you like it?
00:15:15 <Kocho> i don't understand what the dots do
00:15:30 <throatvibrations> you press them
00:15:33 <throatvibrations> to move in that direction
00:15:38 <throatvibrations> or click
00:15:39 <throatvibrations> or swipe
00:15:41 <throatvibrations> or any of those
00:15:49 <medos> i always wanted a website with teleporter
00:16:01 <Sat> arrows would be more intuitive 
00:16:03 <medos> move from one place to the next by clicking
00:16:07 <throatvibrations> lol
00:16:10 <throatvibrations> Sat, I had arrows
00:16:15 <throatvibrations> but I think they looked dumb
00:16:18 <throatvibrations> I'm thinking of doing

00:42:35 <throatvibrations> I am turrible
00:43:08 <Kocho> save for web background @ 45 isn't bad is it/
00:43:34 <throatvibrations> 45 what?
00:43:41 <medos> 45/100
00:43:44 <Kocho> yeah

00:43:47 <Kocho> quality
00:43:52 <throatvibrations> lol
00:43:58 <Kocho> jpg
00:44:00 <throatvibrations> I'd say it depends what the background is
00:44:05 <throatvibrations> If it's a photo, obviously not
00:44:08 <Kocho> like a texture which fades
00:44:11 <Kocho> to a solid
00:44:17 <throatvibrations> Why can't you
00:44:20 <throatvibrations> do 
00:44:23 <throatvibrations> a repeating pattern
00:44:25 <throatvibrations> with a small tile
00:44:27 <throatvibrations> and then have 
00:44:29 <throatvibrations> CSS gradient
00:44:30 <throatvibrations> over
00:44:32 <throatvibrations> nevermind
00:44:33 <Kocho> dont
00:44:34 <Kocho> know
00:44:34 <throatvibrations> dumb suggestion
00:44:34 <Kocho> how
00:44:36 <Kocho> to
00:44:48 <Kocho> its only like 55k
00:44:53 <throatvibrations> but
00:44:55 <medos> that's aiight
00:44:55 <throatvibrations> kocho: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3543887/gradient-alpha-fade-out-effect-with-css-3
00:44:57 <Kocho> and the image is 1900 x 1500
00:45:03 <medos> depends more on how it looks
00:45:07 <Kocho> yeah
00:45:10 <throatvibrations> or http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4480919/can-you-create-gradients-that-fade-to-opacity-using-css-or-javascript
00:45:10 <medos> what's with png?
00:45:13 <Kocho> ill roll with what i got for now
00:45:37 <medos> if it's a repeating pattern png should make it smaller
00:45:40 <medos> if texture then meh
00:45:43 <Kocho> its not
00:45:45 <Kocho> its ok
00:45:46 <Kocho> nvm

01:31:00 <medos> sounds like you're scaling them too much :p
01:31:10 <medos> hi aztec_warrior :)
01:31:11 <aztec_warrior> Hey everyone, i was wondering if you could help me identify what type of drawing this is
01:31:14 <aztec_warrior> https://gs1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/8019B6/data.tumblr.com/tumblr_maigj4gt2Q1re71vio1_500.jpg
01:31:32 <aztec_warrior> like what the proper term is to categorize them
01:31:34 <medos> hmhmhm
01:31:54 <aztec_warrior> idk what to type into google haha something about it fascinates me
01:32:01 <aztec_warrior> the drawing type i mean
01:32:02 <Kocho> looks a bit like blueprints
01:32:11 <throatvibrations> Medos, close. I just realized that since I'm working at 2048x1053046 or whatever, I'm going to have to reinsert the textures if I ever shrink the PSD down instead of scaling them with it
01:32:17 <throatvibrations> And that was the problem :P
01:32:30 <throatvibrations> Yeah
01:32:35 <throatvibrations> Technical drawing?
01:33:17 <aztec_warrior> just a technical drawing? hmm
01:33:32 <aztec_warrior> it reminds me so much of renaissance drawings 
01:33:33 <medos> aztec_warrior in general it would be mandelbrot set, recursive drawing, generative repeating pattern shebang
01:33:42 <throatvibrations> detailed drawings?
01:33:43 <throatvibrations> lol
01:34:20 <aztec_warrior> haha alright thank you
01:34:25 <aztec_warrior> i appreciate it
01:34:27 <medos> nah, that's not the exact term
01:34:33 <medos> i'm looking for a bookmark at the moment
01:34:34 <throatvibrations> Medos, where do you see mandelbrots?

01:44:33 <aztec_warrior> thanks for your help you guys
01:44:52 <medos> http://randommization.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/Steampunk-Mechanical-Animals.jpg
01:45:38 <Kocho> thats pretty cool
01:46:02 <medos> aight
01:46:41 <throatvibrations> hey
01:46:44 <throatvibrations> question
01:46:45 <throatvibrations> http://i.imgur.com/vyhJn.jpg
01:46:51 <throatvibrations> Do you think that's better for navigating
01:46:56 <throatvibrations> then the dots or arrows?
01:47:19 <throatvibrations> If not exactly what I have there ^, at least some variation of showing the edges of the other pages
01:47:24 <throatvibrations> ?
01:47:46 <medos> a wat
01:48:01 <medos> edges of?
01:48:09 <throatvibrations> the other pages
01:48:10 <throatvibrations> like
01:48:17 <medos> huh?
01:48:18 <throatvibrations> if you scroll up or down
01:48:20 <throatvibrations> you go to photos
01:48:22 <throatvibrations> in the same story
01:48:24 <throatvibrations> or left and right
01:48:27 <throatvibrations> to a diff story
01:48:39 <throatvibrations> so
01:48:41 <throatvibrations> I could do
01:48:43 <throatvibrations> oh
01:48:46 <throatvibrations> like
01:48:59 <throatvibrations> show the edges of the photos that are before/next
01:49:02 <throatvibrations> on the top and bottom
01:49:03 <throatvibrations> and then
01:49:09 <throatvibrations> something for the stories to the left and right
01:49:11 <throatvibrations> on the left and right
01:49:39 <Kocho> tw, this project of yours confused me a lot
01:49:44 <Kocho> confuses*
01:50:44 <medos> he's confusing himself enough to ask for help
01:50:53 <throatvibrations> why is it confusing
01:50:55 <throatvibrations> you scroll up or down
01:51:02 <throatvibrations> and you view photos from story 1
01:51:05 <medos> p confusing
01:51:05 <throatvibrations> you scroll left
01:51:08 <throatvibrations> and you go to the index
01:51:09 <throatvibrations> you scroll right
01:51:12 <throatvibrations> and you go to story 2
01:51:24 <throatvibrations> why is that confusing
01:51:41 <medos> see
01:51:49 <medos> you alienate our first time visitors
01:52:06 <throatvibrations> Alienated the aztec warrior
01:52:21 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/SzJXw.png
01:52:23 <medos> yo
01:52:26 <medos> TheWhisper critique?
01:52:28 <medos> good?
01:52:35 <throatvibrations> ...
01:52:37 <medos> or do i need to fix the flow to the left?
01:53:20 <throatvibrations> I assume you're trying to make the point that you can't critique functionality that you haven't actually used yourself.
01:53:51 <medos> you spread your sentences and explanations with so many verbal stuff inbetween that it gets confusing
01:54:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/uqRff.png
01:54:56 <throatvibrations> You scroll up or down in order to view photos from the story you're currently in. If you scroll left from story 1, that takes you to the story index. If you scroll right from story 1, that takes you to story 2.
01:54:58 <throatvibrations> Better?
01:58:37 <medos> tl;dr: copy beta.usatoday.com
02:01:12 <medos> your use of a pic without context made the layout too confusing already
02:02:05 <medos> the whole thing looks too dark
02:02:13 <medos> and muddy a lil'
02:02:16 <medos> try
02:02:18 <medos> more
02:02:20 <medos> stuff

02:16:19 <throatvibrations> lol
02:16:23 <throatvibrations> hm
02:16:23 <zakmac> God that took like… six minutes to propegate
02:16:29 <throatvibrations> I think the textures are exaggerated
02:16:34 <throatvibrations> cuz of jpeg compression
02:21:22 <throatvibrations> well?
02:21:50 <medos> sup
02:22:02 <medos> throatvibrations you wasted about half an hour or more
02:22:06 <medos> talking about your weird layout
02:22:09 <medos> instead of improving it
02:22:10 <medos> :)
02:22:45 <medos> if it's visually not at a point where people comment (like this case)
02:22:49 <Kocho> ?TheWhisper
02:22:54 <Kocho> owned
02:22:58 <throatvibrations> Lol
02:23:05 <medos> it's not at the point of critiqeworthyness yet
02:23:07 <medos> ?whisper
02:23:09 <throatvibrations> Except I've been sketching stuff
02:23:11 <throatvibrations> so 
02:23:14 <throatvibrations> Not wasted ;)
02:23:19 <medos> k
02:23:36 <throatvibrations> Can you explain though
02:23:40 <throatvibrations> what you mean by the colors
02:23:47 <throatvibrations> and then copying usatoday
02:23:49 <throatvibrations> do you mean
02:23:51 <throatvibrations> copy their colors
02:23:56 <throatvibrations> or their nav?
02:24:50 <medos> asking more questions will help
02:25:01 <medos> compare
02:25:02 <throatvibrations> ...
02:25:03 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/1GNR1.png
02:25:15 <medos> to
02:25:34 <medos> (imgur is uploading forever)
02:25:52 <medos> well compare that to your use of two colors and one shade of each color
02:25:59 <throatvibrations> ah
02:26:11 <medos> so
02:26:13 <throatvibrations> Hm
02:26:17 <medos> ask me more questions
02:26:26 <throatvibrations> But I'm not sure if mine /needs/ to have more colors
02:26:27 <medos> so i end up designing your site
02:26:33 <throatvibrations> usatoday has a ton of content
02:26:37 <throatvibrations> so they have tons of colors
02:26:41 <throatvibrations> to color code it
02:26:43 <throatvibrations> my site
02:26:45 <throatvibrations> has little content
02:26:49 <throatvibrations> hm
02:27:20 <medos> whatever books you're reading about color theory
02:27:25 <medos> aren't really helping
02:28:02 <medos> feel free to ask more questions
02:28:05 <medos> i can answer them
02:28:07 <throatvibrations> Cuz I haven't read books about color theory
02:28:08 <throatvibrations> lol
02:28:09 <medos> make new mockups for you
02:28:10 <throatvibrations> probs why
02:28:12 <medos> wait
02:28:19 <medos> you haven't?
02:28:27 <throatvibrations> nope
02:28:38 <medos> way to go
02:28:49 <throatvibrations> lol
02:28:53 <throatvibrations> If I had, I'd probs be better at it ;)
02:29:36 <medos> yeah
02:29:43 <zakmac> http://i.imgur.com/dCMIw.png
02:29:49 <zakmac> MY SHIT IS FOR REAL, SON
02:30:20 <Kocho> yep
02:30:23 <Kocho> its all real
02:30:28 <Kocho> everything you see is real
02:30:30 <Kocho> even if its fake
02:31:58 <medos> it's so tiresome
02:32:02 <Kocho> what else you wanna know?
02:32:02 <medos> to try to explain something
02:32:14 <medos> presuming that the guy knows what he does
02:32:19 <medos> somehow
02:32:21 <zakmac> http://fuelnanny.com/car-info
02:32:28 <zakmac> My shit is super for real. For real
02:32:29 <throatvibrations> I don't know anything :)
02:32:44 <throatvibrations> Also, medos, you'd be a bad teacher
02:32:47 <throatvibrations> :P
02:32:50 <medos> no
02:32:55 <medos> i'm not your teacher
02:32:57 <Kocho> nice zak!
02:33:01 <medos> i'm not teaching you anymore
02:33:01 <throatvibrations> okay
02:33:05 <medos> i'm just wasting your time
02:33:07 <medos> for the most part
02:33:11 <throatvibrations> :(
02:33:12 <throatvibrations> mean
02:33:35 <Kocho> brb lunchies
02:33:40 <medos> just trying to get you to man up and solve your problems yourself for once
02:33:46 <medos> ?whythewhisperasks
02:33:50 <throatvibrations> Pfft
02:33:54 <medos> i'm serious
02:34:03 <throatvibrations> But you're also wrong
02:34:25 <throatvibrations> You're equating wanting simple solutions to unimportant problems with laziness.
02:34:28 <throatvibrations> While in this case
02:34:30 <throatvibrations> of this design
02:34:36 <medos> it's unimportant
02:34:45 <throatvibrations> I'm simply asking for advice and suggestions as to what route would be the best to go in
02:34:48 <throatvibrations> in your opinions
02:34:59 <throatvibrations> And the unimportant thing = asking about like settings of programs and shit
02:35:02 <throatvibrations> not the design
02:35:18 <medos> i can't differentiate so everything you ask = lazyness
02:35:30 <throatvibrations> Lol
02:36:02 <medos> zakmac that looks slick, could use a instant-result-searchbar or something
02:36:59 <zakmac> That's what the right is a tech demo of but it appears broken since I moved the db connect info from its template file

03:41:59 <marshmallow> nope 
03:42:05 <marshmallow> <--samsung galaxy s2
03:42:11 <marshmallow> i can try my ipod
03:42:15 <marshmallow> but idk if it's updated enough
03:42:27 <marshmallow> crap
03:42:34 <marshmallow> how do i get ios5?
03:43:05 <marshmallow> ah shit
03:43:12 <marshmallow> that'll take forever
03:43:26 <marshmallow> cause i don't think this computer & my ipod's music are the same
03:43:36 <marshmallow> cause i don't believe i've set it up yet
03:43:37 <marshmallow> lol
03:45:03 <marshmallow> yup, confirmed...  I didn't set up my music on this computer
03:45:29 <marshmallow> if I plug in my ipod to sync it for ios5, it'll wipe the music out, correct?
03:48:49 <marshmallow> -.-
03:48:59 <marshmallow> maybe i should just wait for android version
03:51:19 <marshmallow> or tomorrow i'll figure it out
03:51:30 <marshmallow> gees, my music is litterally all over the place >_<;;

04:27:56 <TheWhisper> could be funny though
04:38:16 <marshmallow> oh, hmr..  it should premiere well
04:38:25 <marshmallow> since it's after modern family
04:38:42 <marshmallow> might be a keeper
04:40:05 <IAmLegend> we have a show called Neighbours
04:40:11 <IAmLegend> i thought you were looking that up
04:40:40 <marshmallow> oh, it's a new show on ABC
04:41:53 <marshmallow> it'll premiere well, but then suck when they change it's timeslot
04:42:33 <marshmallow> right now it's after Modern Family (so lots of extra viewers.)  Next week they're moving it BEFORE Modern Family (likely LOTS of fewer viewers)
04:42:41 <marshmallow> may or may not survive
04:44:59 <marshmallow> scratch that..  modern family isn't airing next week
04:45:08 <marshmallow> Neighbours is screwed XD
04:46:56 <marshmallow> dunno, still really early to predict
04:50:06 <marshmallow> hmrr...  ABC canceled 9 shows last year

12:53:29 <Sat> 7 upvotes, aww your so kind :D
12:53:47 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/SrEjb.png
12:53:50 * medos is using nbs-irc 2.39 (theme: pink fantasy) - www.nbs-irc.net
12:54:39 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/P3yZd.png
12:55:52 <Sat> had this on mac, looked for similar on windows and couldnt find http://colloquy.info/
12:55:55 <medos> if you want colored names

12:59:22 <medos> not a real irc client but it looks similar ?
13:00:13 <Sat> confused
13:02:07 <medos> .dict pidgin im
13:02:17 <Sat> you've done enought anyway dont worry, i was hoping someone would have "The answer" instantly. You've pointed me in the direction of themes
13:04:07 <medos> http://www.ntalk.de/Nettalk/en/index.php?page=Screen or http://www.pidgin.im/about/
13:04:35 <medos> i never used collapsequy
13:04:47 <medos> so i can't vouch for usability similarities
13:05:00 <medos> but these two clients kiinda look like that
13:05:08 <Sat> basically had a msn feel
13:05:15 <medos> pidgin
13:06:31 <medos> or miranda
13:06:50 <medos> both multi-protocol IM clients with irc feature

14:28:07 <marshmallow> i don't think so
14:28:12 <marshmallow> I'm pretty sure I'm on 4?

14:28:41 <marshmallow> that too
14:28:44 <medos> so i thought your ipad
14:28:50 <medos> might be ios5
14:28:55 <marshmallow> both are not on 5
14:28:55 <medos> hmk
14:28:58 <medos> :[
14:29:12 <marshmallow> yea, I'll work on trying to figure out how to upgrade later
14:29:29 <marshmallow> it was midnight-ish yesterday
14:29:36 <marshmallow> so I was too lazy to do it yesterday
14:29:48 <medos> meh, you might not want to upgrade if your ipad/pod are older
14:30:00 <medos> because newer ios versions are more hardware intense
14:30:06 <marshmallow> oh
14:30:10 <medos> so general usage might get worse
14:30:19 <marshmallow> yea, my ipod is pretty old
14:30:29 <marshmallow> but i still gotta figure out how to sync it with my computer
14:30:35 <marshmallow> it's synced with my old computer
14:30:59 <marshmallow> my ipod touch doesn't have a camera
14:31:02 <marshmallow> whatever generation that is
14:32:46 <marshmallow> it's either the 2nd or 3rd generation
14:33:55 <medos> yeah, leave it be
14:34:00 <medos> would kill battery
14:34:11 <medos> and apps would stutter because of more constantly running clutter
14:34:41 <marshmallow> wiki says it doesn't matter.  iOS 4.2.1. is the highest it can go
14:34:47 <marshmallow> for 2nd & 3rd gen
14:34:57 <marshmallow> looks like my ipod can't download fridge pal
14:35:48 <Satz>  I can't remember how to import all the pages of a  pdf to illustrator. i'm sure i did it in the past
14:36:22 <marshmallow> i have no idea Sat
14:36:28 <marshmallow> I wish I knew =(
14:36:39 <marshmallow> oh hai, my iPad2 can get ios5
14:36:42 <marshmallow> i'll look into that too
14:36:49 <marshmallow> later.  
14:36:55 <medos> lelele
14:36:59 <medos> yeah
14:37:05 <medos> ipad 2 would be worth it
14:37:11 <medos> because that should be powerful enough
14:37:34 <marshmallow> yay!
14:37:58 <marshmallow> idk, I don't upgrade.  my android is still on gingerbread (I think.)
14:38:00 <marshmallow> tee hee
14:39:28 <marshmallow> but it's also the older model (samsung galaxy s2), so I think ice cream/jellybean would kill my phone.
14:39:38 <marshmallow> not gonna lie, I like the android names.  hahaha.. 
14:40:19 <medos> u jelly?
14:40:24 <medos> no ginger

14:51:51 <TheWhisper> Hm
14:52:00 <TheWhisper> Windows 8 certifications doesn't really sound like a bad thing
14:52:17 <TheWhisper> Because they don't limit non-certified apps from being installed, as far as I can tell
14:53:23 <TheWhisper> Need to read the entire thing though
14:55:44 <medos> it's like smartphone apps
14:55:46 <medos> you install
14:55:51 <medos> they have a container they sit in
14:55:54 <medos> you click delete
14:55:56 <medos> they're gone
14:56:27 <medos> that's why gabeN threw a fit in the first place
14:56:39 <medos> ease of use vs downloading installing and using steam
14:58:10 <TheWhisper> Well, your computer is like a dump truck
14:58:12 <marshmallow> <@TheWhisper> It was weird <-- Idk if I plan on watching Neighbors =/
14:58:14 <TheWhisper> and the internet is a series of tubes
14:58:20 <TheWhisper> that dump into your truck
14:58:24 <marshmallow> I think I'm gonna watch Elementary today (new series / CBS)
14:58:27 <TheWhisper> and I'm not going anywhere with this
14:58:38 <TheWhisper> besides here
14:58:39 <medos> yes you are
14:58:43 <TheWhisper> .y series of tubes
14:58:49 <medos> your truck is full of containers
14:58:56 <medos> windows 8 can throw those containers out again
14:59:00 <TheWhisper> but other apps
14:59:06 <TheWhisper> that are not certified
14:59:09 <TheWhisper> could eithe be containers
14:59:11 <medos> will still litter
14:59:16 <medos> how they want
14:59:17 <TheWhisper> or just trash not in bags
14:59:19 <TheWhisper> and spread around the truck
14:59:33 <medos> yeah
14:59:40 <medos> there's trucks like ccleaner though

17:31:56 <medos> i solely hate that fridge because nazbot wanted one that looked like it
17:32:03 <medos> guess what that would've gotten me on dribbble
17:32:11 <medos> a copycat beating at best
17:32:51 <zakmac> I like the name Dribble because it brings to mind people prematurely ejaculating which is great because 90% of the site is one tiny, unfinished part of a much larger project that people juice themselves over
17:33:00 <zakmac> They've accidentally given it the most accurate name possible
17:33:11 <medos> not sure if it was accidental
17:33:27 <medos> but the downloads quadrupled after posting the icon there
17:34:54 <medos> -quadrupled +were slightly higher

17:50:21 <medos> awesome
17:52:06 <R0tt3n> yo medos, what do you think of this podster type? http://i.imgur.com/CDoeE.png
17:52:15 <R0tt3n> Poster*
17:52:40 <R0tt3n> should i remove the "Only at play" part
17:52:49 <R0tt3n> cause like it seems kind of redundant
17:53:45 <medos> whoa
17:54:22 <medos> small caps aren't aaaaalways fitting
17:54:43 <medos> at least not when you mix small caps all caps
17:54:49 <R0tt3n> yeah I know, its the font though, they dont have anything else but small caps
17:54:59 <R0tt3n> should i jsut go all large?
17:56:37 <medos> use ITC Kabel
17:56:40 <medos> or Futura maybe
17:56:44 <medos> if you want a style like that
17:56:58 <medos> i just don't like the font at all (personal subjective comment)
17:58:42 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/QCvoV.png
18:01:40 <R0tt3n> i see i see
18:01:47 <R0tt3n> i just really like the A's and N's
18:01:48 <R0tt3n> ahah
18:03:14 <R0tt3n> but, should i take out the Only at play part?
18:04:02 <medos> D:
18:04:21 <medos> i vote yeah
18:09:07 <medos> did you do your research this time around?
18:09:44 <R0tt3n> yes yes lol
18:11:32 <medos> awesome
18:14:00 <R0tt3n> heres an example of a finished one
18:14:02 <R0tt3n> http://i.imgur.com/b3yjP.png
18:18:26 <marshmallow> TED?
18:19:05 <marshmallow> when I see TED, I don't think of dancing & playing
18:19:11 <marshmallow> just saying =p
18:19:48 <marshmallow> i think of a good concept, awful ending
18:19:55 <marshmallow> gawd awful =/
18:20:03 <medos> wha
18:22:15 <R0tt3n> lol
18:22:35 <R0tt3n> i just used ted as a placeholder, the person in the middle is gonna change everyweek
18:22:40 <TheWhisper> Guess who just spent a half an hour cleaning up the mess his roommates have left in his kitchen over the past month?
18:23:06 <TheWhisper> I agree with that site marshmallow lol
18:23:38 <marshmallow> woot
18:24:24 <marshmallow> That site is pretty accurate.  I followed it last year and they were pretty spot on with all their predictions
18:25:26 <R0tt3n> what about when you see scarlett johansson?
18:26:46 <TheWhisper> hm
18:26:56 <TheWhisper> R0tt3n, I don't like that red
18:27:01 <TheWhisper> and I think
18:27:12 <TheWhisper> The copy still doesn't make sense
18:27:18 <medos> play play play
18:27:21 <TheWhisper> Can we see what one of the real images would look like in it?
18:27:32 <TheWhisper> Medos, what doyou think Play is?
18:27:35 <TheWhisper> Based off his poster
18:27:45 <medos> the TED one or the empty one?
18:27:49 <TheWhisper> Empty
18:28:07 * marshmallow knows
18:28:18 <marshmallow> i think
18:28:35 <TheWhisper> Do you know or are you just guessing?
18:28:37 <medos> sounds like a festival
18:28:41 <TheWhisper> I wanna see what someone who doesn't know would thing
18:28:41 <medos> or afternoon event
18:28:41 <R0tt3n> http://i.imgur.com/dZOo8.png
18:28:42 <TheWhisper> **think
18:28:45 <medos> i know what it is
18:28:58 <R0tt3n> thats the person i plan on using for this week
18:29:01 <medos> i just tried to think without pretenses
18:29:03 <TheWhisper> yeah
18:29:22 <TheWhisper> As it is now, I don't get 'dance club where people also go to have sex'
18:29:23 <medos> *prewhateverknowledge
18:29:44 <medos> as i see it that's pretty ballsy copyright sue material right there
18:29:52 <TheWhisper> ?
18:29:59 <TheWhisper> What is?
18:30:03 <TheWhisper> Oh scarjo
18:30:04 <TheWhisper> wait
18:30:11 <TheWhisper> Yeah, you can't use Scarjo, r0tt3n
18:30:12 <TheWhisper> lol
18:30:25 <marshmallow> don't you have photos of girls from the place?
18:30:33 <medos> TED is also a huuuuuuge no go
18:30:36 <TheWhisper> Options: 1) Take photos of models yourself
18:30:40 <TheWhisper> 2) Don't use a photo
18:30:45 <TheWhisper> 3) Request photos from the place
18:30:51 <TheWhisper> 4) Hire a person to take photos of models
18:31:03 <marshmallow> do request 3!
18:31:03 <TheWhisper> 5) Use photos of yourself + frends
18:31:10 <TheWhisper> I'd say those are your options
18:31:19 <TheWhisper> Well
18:31:26 <TheWhisper> 6) Buy stock imagery
18:31:31 <TheWhisper> But that's a bad option imo
18:33:12 <marshmallow> option 3!
18:34:05 <R0tt3n> well, the client specified he wanted it done like that. "Every week, put another celebrity/pop culture presence and add the play logo onto them"
18:34:20 <TheWhisper> Yeah, that's illegal though
18:34:24 <marshmallow> that's illegal
18:34:54 <TheWhisper> Wel
18:34:57 <TheWhisper> *Well
18:35:04 <marshmallow> unless if you purchase that image from like gettysimage
18:35:09 <marshmallow> gettysimage has a lot of celebrities
18:35:10 <TheWhisper> In the US, it's not straight up illegal
18:35:31 <R0tt3n> so how should i bring this up to him?
18:35:38 <medos> not at all
18:35:41 <TheWhisper> In the US, you have to prove that you're doing it satirically/parodically and that you're not slandering them
18:35:47 <TheWhisper> I'm not sure how it is in Canada
18:35:57 <medos> i would say keep the job and do it
18:36:17 <R0tt3n> its the same in canada 
18:36:24 <marshmallow> can't you get in trouble with copyright infringement?
18:36:25 <TheWhisper> Medos has a point though
18:36:36 <TheWhisper> You wouldn't be the one getting in trouble
18:36:37 <medos> if you had stated from the beginning
18:36:37 <TheWhisper> I don't think
18:36:43 <TheWhisper> I think it would be the client
18:36:46 <medos> "you do know this is illegal?"
18:36:47 <TheWhisper> Though idk
18:36:55 <medos> or copyright problemstopblemseomen
18:36:57 <TheWhisper> Well, he didn't know it was illegal
18:37:24 <medos> it's a local club, i've seen plenty of stock imagery from sxc.hu and so on in local flyers without attribution
18:37:27 <marshmallow> idk, i've brought it up before.  I usually say "I cannot use that photo you found on google since it's copyright infrigement"  how about this one instead?
18:37:43 <medos> marshmallow you do it from the getgo though
18:37:49 <medos> that's a different thing to doing 3 posters
18:37:52 <medos> and then saying
18:37:54 <TheWhisper> http://goo.gl/enVDb r0tt3n
18:37:56 <medos> "can't do it man"
18:38:15 <marshmallow> oh, i thought we were in the beginning -.-
18:38:19 <TheWhisper> It's also an integrity thing too
18:38:21 <TheWhisper> If you don't care
18:38:24 <TheWhisper> then eh fuck it
18:39:07 <TheWhisper> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_rights#Canada r0tt3n
18:39:16 <R0tt3n> well I'm not gonna be using these in my book, its kind of just a paycheck 
18:40:24 <medos> do you have any written confirmation that he explicitly asked for "famous popculture icons on posters"?
18:40:24 <TheWhisper> Then if you don't care
18:40:30 <R0tt3n> does an email count?
18:40:33 <TheWhisper> and you can cover your ass on the off chance someone sues
18:40:38 <TheWhisper> Then go for it
18:40:45 <marshmallow> can't he blame it on you then and be like, "I thought my designer paid for it"
18:40:48 <marshmallow> ?
18:41:56 <medos> .g ltdex
18:42:21 <medos> ^ this guy gets away with it
18:42:25 <medos> afaik
18:42:40 <medos> i think stuff like that counts as derivative
18:42:42 <medos> work
18:42:43 <medos> no idea
18:43:02 <TheWhisper> hm
18:43:19 <TheWhisper> I think the reason he gets away with it
18:43:30 <TheWhisper> is he's not using their images to /promote a product or service/
18:43:37 <marshmallow> I mean, you're very likely not to get caught.  I just prefer I guess to be legit.  The last thing I would ever want is to have this bite my ass.
18:44:10 <TheWhisper> You specificially can't use images of celebs to promote or sell products services
18:44:22 <TheWhisper> Because that's deceptive
18:44:30 <TheWhisper> and showing that the celebrity endorses said product
18:44:34 <TheWhisper> even if they don't actually
18:44:50 <TheWhisper> Using it as a standalone image or as parody or as the product (?) is a different story
18:44:54 <TheWhisper> I think
18:45:12 <marshmallow> that's not a standalone image.  clearly an unsolicit endorsement
18:45:35 <TheWhisper> exactly
18:45:36 <TheWhisper> http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/business/media/07garment.html?_r=0
18:45:45 <TheWhisper> "This ad is clearly misleading because the company suggests the approval or endorsement of the president or the White House that it does not have,"
18:46:23 <R0tt3n> so should I edit the photo to make it count as a parody?
18:46:35 <medos> mhmhmhm
18:46:42 <TheWhisper> http://forums.digitalpoint.com/showthread.php?t=59343
18:46:44 <TheWhisper> um
18:46:56 <TheWhisper> Well
18:47:02 <TheWhisper> Again, I don't know how it is in Canada
18:47:31 <medos> it's like a german food website
18:47:39 <medos> which solely shows and hosts stock photos of food
18:47:45 <medos> to wait till someone steals them
18:47:56 <TheWhisper> lol
18:48:21 <TheWhisper> You can also use photos from prior to 1923 ;)
18:48:25 <TheWhisper> Those are all in the public domain 
18:48:27 <TheWhisper> so like
18:48:49 <TheWhisper> Get a photo of 
18:48:52 <marshmallow> Lol at the obama ad.  
18:48:56 <TheWhisper> Totally blanking on a person
18:49:17 <medos> http://news.monstersandcritics.com/europe/news/article_1513221.php/German-high-court-tightens-internet-copyright-law
18:49:18 <TheWhisper> Henry Ford from before 1923
18:49:26 <TheWhisper> and have him partying in the club
18:49:26 <TheWhisper> lol
18:49:32 <medos> or you use public domain photos
18:49:40 <medos> which are explicitly public domain
18:50:09 <TheWhisper> Yeah
18:50:16 <R0tt3n> where can i get public domain photos?
18:50:17 <TheWhisper> Creative Commons too maybe
18:50:22 <TheWhisper> http://search.creativecommons.org/
18:51:26 <TheWhisper> Though
18:51:27 <TheWhisper> hm
18:51:43 <TheWhisper> I'm not sure how it would work if you used a CC/public photo of someone like Scarjo
18:51:54 <TheWhisper> Because even though the photo is not copyrighted
18:52:03 <TheWhisper> You're still using their image as an endorsement
18:52:13 <TheWhisper> I'd personally just stay away from celebs
18:52:17 <TheWhisper> And just find hot chicks
18:52:34 <TheWhisper> Up to you though
18:52:38 <TheWhisper> Sorry :(
18:52:48 <R0tt3n> true, ill do that then
18:52:52 <marshmallow> I would use hot chicks
18:53:17 <marshmallow> cause having celebs is super misleading.  that usually implies they're gonna be at the club that night =/
18:53:41 <marshmallow> at least, that's what i expect
18:53:50 <marshmallow> and if you don't deliver, I wouldn't come back.
18:53:52 <marshmallow> but that's just me =p
18:54:03 <TheWhisper> Wow, nazbot, fail on the app settings :P
18:54:28 <R0tt3n> but looking past the total ripoff, what do you think of the design?
18:54:39 <TheWhisper> hm
18:54:43 <TheWhisper> link again?
18:54:53 <marshmallow> too clean.  lol
18:55:02 <R0tt3n> http://i.imgur.com/dZOo8.png
18:55:34 <marshmallow> any info like cost of drinks?  price at door?  deals for ladies?
18:55:53 <TheWhisper> hm
18:55:59 <R0tt3n> Nah thats all gonna be on the event info
18:56:15 <R0tt3n> this is pretty much just for facebook
18:56:17 <R0tt3n> no print
18:56:27 <TheWhisper> Well, where's the FB url?
18:56:51 <TheWhisper> And I don't think that's a good idea to not have that info on the poster
18:56:57 <marshmallow> you really don't wanna highlight that?  o_O?
18:57:02 <TheWhisper> By the time I go home, I'll have forgotten to check the URL.
18:57:04 <R0tt3n> its not uploaded yet, its gonna get put onto an event page
18:57:30 <TheWhisper> Well, you still should put in a placeholder URL at least
18:58:07 <marshmallow> not using the picture like on twitter?
18:58:14 <marshmallow> (thus you SHOULD put that info on the poster)
18:59:00 <R0tt3n> so a link to the event page? or should i just link it to the club's facebook page since all their events are gonna be on there anyways
18:59:35 <marshmallow> no
18:59:45 <marshmallow> well, I mean you could put the link to the club
18:59:57 <marshmallow> but you really should also advertise cost of drinks / price at door /deals for ladies
19:00:02 <marshmallow> (if they are good)
19:01:31 <R0tt3n> well this is what another club has done for their weekly events
19:01:32 <R0tt3n> http://sphotos-a.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/538103_357518234307256_311900901_n.jpg
19:02:05 <R0tt3n> it doesn't even list the address ahah
19:02:17 <TheWhisper> hm
19:02:27 <TheWhisper> Yeah, I'd just be like 'cool i'll look online later'
19:02:29 <TheWhisper> and then not remember
19:03:06 <R0tt3n> so what would make you remember?
19:03:22 <marshmallow> maybe nyc clubs just have different styles...
19:03:36 <marshmallow> i would like to grab a bunch of them for you, but i'm afraid of the nsfw ones
19:03:44 <TheWhisper> What would make me remembe
19:03:46 <TheWhisper> er
19:03:50 <TheWhisper> is having the information on it
19:03:51 <TheWhisper> lol
19:03:54 <TheWhisper> lol marshmallow

19:10:00 <TheWhisper> idiots
19:12:11 <R0tt3n> guest list info is whoever says they're attending the event on facebook, thats kind of the norm for people in toronto
19:13:01 <TheWhisper> You don't need a guest list on it
19:13:01 <R0tt3n> you're put on the geustlist if you say you're attending on the facebook event is what i mean to say
19:13:03 <TheWhisper> what

19:13:33 <R0tt3n> yeah sorry i worded it weird before
19:14:31 <marshmallow> wow?  really?  it's that easy?

19:18:42 <marshmallow> haven't seen it
19:18:52 <marshmallow> oy, and I agree with the comment also about their clothes
19:19:02 <marshmallow> i too was like..  how did she get that brown leather jacket?!
19:19:11 <marshmallow> where is the DIY tutorial for me to make that?!
19:19:15 <TheWhisper> That's one thing that was done REALLY well in Lost, I think
19:19:24 <marshmallow> the outfits?
19:19:26 <TheWhisper> well
19:19:29 <TheWhisper> the choices i mean
19:19:31 <TheWhisper> but the outfits too
19:19:39 <marshmallow> i didn't watch lost
19:19:42 <TheWhisper> But in lost, even when someone made a choice that I didn't agree with
19:19:48 <TheWhisper> I never thought it was a /dumb/ choice
19:20:04 <TheWhisper> They always had a solid foundation in 1) their character's personality and 2) the show's plot
19:20:08 <TheWhisper> for doing said thing
19:20:21 <TheWhisper> Instead of just 'oh but i dont like killing lololol'
19:20:29 <TheWhisper> 'but hey lemme shoot this guy point blank in the chest!'
19:20:47 <TheWhisper> 'even though he's a sadistic murderous sociopath i'm gonna mourn him after too'
19:20:55 <marshmallow> lol!
19:21:07 <marshmallow> yea, I was like..  how the hell is this child still alive
19:21:14 <marshmallow> you live in a kill or be killed world
19:21:19 <marshmallow> get with the program!
19:21:29 <TheWhisper> "THE SAME SHIT was pushed with Terra Nova: "Don't go outside the gate, there's fucking dinosaurs that will fuck you up!!!!"
19:21:30 <TheWhisper> ...Few episodes later: "Let's sneak out, there's no danger at all.""
19:21:33 <TheWhisper> ^ yes
19:21:44 <TheWhisper> I mean, I can understand how she's alive
19:21:49 <TheWhisper> she lived with her parents
19:21:53 <TheWhisper> and was probs sheltered to an extent
19:21:56 <TheWhisper> so that's reasonable
19:22:00 <TheWhisper> but not realistic
19:22:37 <TheWhisper> "They're obviously afraid that full-on science fiction will prevent the show from finding a large audience, so they emphasize the schmalz and generic family drama designed to bring in 40-year-old housewives. The post-apocalyptic setting and 'mystery' is just window-dressing to get Lost-style serialized mystery fanboys on board."
19:22:39 <TheWhisper> yes
19:22:40 <TheWhisper> that
19:23:21 <marshmallow> ack, basically there's a lot of plot holes
19:24:01 <TheWhisper> yup
19:24:12 <TheWhisper> That's what you get on big budget appeal-to-everyone shows
19:24:31 <marshmallow> My problem with the show is I keep thinking. What happened to Magnetism? Well if physics doesnt work for electricity anymore, why does gravity work? What about nuclear power plants? If electricity failed did every single one go Fukashima at the same time? Shouldnt the devastation have effected suburban Chicago a little more. Does steam power not work? Bah. My brain doesnt stop.
19:24:36 <marshmallow> ^^ LOL
19:25:33 <marshmallow> maybe i should read the book instead
19:25:36 <marshmallow> looks interesting
19:27:07 <marshmallow> In the pilot when planes are literally just falling straight down out of the sky. Yet things like crossbows still fire in straight lines. I'm watching just for the explanation on that one. 
19:27:11 <marshmallow> ^^ MORE LAWLS
19:27:46 <TheWhisper> hm
19:27:56 <TheWhisper> If this happened
19:27:59 <TheWhisper> I would go 
19:28:00 <TheWhisper> hm
19:28:04 <TheWhisper> where would I go
19:28:19 <TheWhisper> library
19:28:21 <TheWhisper> + plant store
19:30:36 <R0tt3n> where do you think this guy got his texture? http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/4094/screenshots/581368/drib69.jpg
19:31:12 <R0tt3n> i was thinking maybe some type of fabric
19:31:16 <marshmallow> For me, I would think the Amish would be front and center in a time like this. They have a fully functioning society without electricity. First thing I'd do is load up all my firearms and go find me some Amish to protect and beg them to teach me. As for the clothes, i have so many tshirts that I could see wearing them out one at a time and still having many like new ones in 15 years.
19:31:23 <marshmallow> ^^ that guy has a pretty good answer
19:31:40 <marshmallow> btw, I would travel by bike.  none of this silly walking nonsense
19:34:08 <medos> oh dear
19:34:44 <TheWhisper> whoa http://www.reddit.com/r/scifi/comments/10kakd/revolution_nbc_show_the_emberverse_and_my_rant/c6eaawz
19:35:04 <TheWhisper> r0tt3n looks like a bad use of subtlepatterns.com
19:36:17 <R0tt3n> i looked on subtlepatterns but couldnt find anything that fit
19:36:28 <medos> lol
19:36:32 <R0tt3n> i think he colour ranged a texture
19:37:02 <medos> never
19:37:52 <marshmallow> gees, maybe I shouldn't read that book
19:38:38 <TheWhisper> ""Drummond said that the limelight is of a such dazzling whiteness that it is plainly visible sixty-eight miles away, and it is reported that a sharp shadow was cast at a distance of thirteen miles.""
19:38:39 <TheWhisper> whoa
19:38:42 <TheWhisper> limelight sounds cool
19:38:44 * marshmallow is really confused on the artistic direction r0tt3n is going..  guess you guys are 10x more classy then american clubs XD
19:39:26 <medos> he wants the average visitor to gaze at those dots
19:40:32 <R0tt3n> no lol im not going to use that texture in the poster
19:40:40 <R0tt3n> i just want to know where he got it for future projects
19:41:40 <medos> mhhhh
19:41:43 <medos> hmmmmmmmm
19:42:09 <TheWhisper> Medos, the professors had a lot to say about the mockup of the site
19:42:11 <TheWhisper> :P
19:42:29 <medos> good for you
19:42:36 <TheWhisper> Going to be working on it tonight
19:42:49 <marshmallow> http://www.uniquedesignz.net/works/tag/nightlife/page/2/ <-- ah ha.  these are what i'm used to seeing
19:43:09 <TheWhisper> They said that they wanted a different color scheme
19:43:15 <medos> really
19:43:23 <TheWhisper> and we spitballed and decided that something
19:43:29 <TheWhisper> with more contrast
19:43:32 <TheWhisper> but no 
19:43:40 <TheWhisper> no like
19:43:42 <TheWhisper> primary colors
19:43:46 <TheWhisper> like reds, greens, etc etc
19:43:48 <TheWhisper> insteado
19:44:19 <TheWhisper> more like
19:44:20 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/cZWbW.png
19:44:26 <TheWhisper> keeping it simple
19:44:32 <TheWhisper> so that the photos still stand out
19:45:52 <marshmallow> idk
19:46:10 <TheWhisper> kdi?
19:46:30 <marshmallow> how often do you go clubbing?
19:47:11 <medos> R0tt3n
19:47:12 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/CdeHM.jpg
19:47:18 <medos> ^ that's where he got it from i bet
19:47:39 <R0tt3n> a scanner?
19:47:48 <medos> yussssss
19:48:06 <R0tt3n> what did he scan? Fabric or something/
19:48:33 <TheWhisper> I don't go clubbing
19:48:43 <TheWhisper> I think it's boring
19:49:42 <medos> his head
19:49:44 <medos> i guess
19:49:44 <medos> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/07/mixing-up-illustration-combining-analog-and-digital-techniques/
19:49:47 <medos> or he did this
19:49:55 <medos> i usually use a scanner to scan my head
19:50:06 <marshmallow> you're suggesting boring colors schemes
19:50:11 <medos> also
19:50:13 <medos> don't use a texture as texture

23:37:06 <TheWhisper> He used it
23:37:28 <medos> what does someone do who likes to borrow color schemes from open source products?
