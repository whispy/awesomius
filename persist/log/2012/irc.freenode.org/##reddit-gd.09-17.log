01:32:08 <medos> and i kinda regret that windows 8 doesn't look like those screenshots

01:34:49 <medos> what's up?
01:36:13 <AmandaS4ys> not a lotta
01:37:28 <AmandaS4ys> gotta develop an iphone app for a concept development class and i'm dreading doing the PRD
01:37:31 <AmandaS4ys> ugh
01:38:12 <medos> develop in theory?
01:38:17 <AmandaS4ys> yeah
01:38:18 <medos> like
01:38:23 <medos> oh dang
01:38:27 <medos> you're a few minutes too late
01:38:30 <AmandaS4ys> why so?

01:38:39 <medos> http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/24/2822891/windows-desktop-ui-concept
01:38:59 <medos> were talking about redesigns a bit
01:39:07 <medos> ?psd
01:39:10 <AmandaS4ys> oh damn :(
01:39:31 <medos> http://kbsportfolio.com/2011/10/17/resource-for-designer-iphone-app-retina/
01:39:36 <medos> http://pixelsdaily.com/resources/photoshop/psds/layers-iphone-app-interface-psd/
01:39:44 <medos> those should make your life a little easier i guess
01:39:55 <AmandaS4ys> i appreciate it :)
01:40:04 <medos> i guess it's more about mockups and prototyping though
01:40:13 <AmandaS4ys> thats exactly what i need
01:40:17 <TheWhisper> nffff medos
01:40:21 <TheWhisper> that windows redesign
01:40:22 <TheWhisper> reminds me of
01:40:24 <TheWhisper> uh
01:40:27 <TheWhisper> outlook.com
01:40:45 <medos> yup
01:40:51 <AmandaS4ys> thank ya
01:40:57 <AmandaS4ys> and question because you would know this
01:41:15 <AmandaS4ys> what are the literal steps of developing an app?
01:41:26 <TheWhisper> The one bad thing about his redesign
01:41:32 <TheWhisper> is there's little differentiation between apps
01:41:43 <TheWhisper> It might get confused to know which app you're in at first glance
01:41:58 <medos> .g apple ios human interface guidelines
01:42:39 <medos> Apple has some pretty swell documents about this.
01:42:43 <AmandaS4ys> true
01:42:58 <AmandaS4ys> only reason i ask, is because i have to do a gant (?) production schedule
01:43:05 <TheWhisper> Ugh
01:43:15 <TheWhisper> I hate gant 
01:43:19 <TheWhisper> They make shitty clothes

01:45:29 <TheWhisper> If Netflix had good shit (that I haven't already seen), I'd say eh
01:45:39 <TheWhisper> but I don't care about my recommendations now
01:45:43 <TheWhisper> as I've seen everything 
01:45:54 <EDSGD> Everything he says
01:46:00 <AmandaS4ys> blahhh i feel like i should pay you medos haha
01:46:07 <AmandaS4ys> youre like... too helpful :P

01:46:48 <EDSGD> I need money.
01:47:16 <AmandaS4ys> i need food
01:47:17 <AmandaS4ys> >.>
01:47:20 <medos> AmandaS4ys major aspect of those gantt thingies are milestones you have to account for
01:47:27 <AmandaS4ys> right
01:47:31 <medos> aaaaand eventual revision phases
01:47:38 <AmandaS4ys> right
01:48:09 <EDSGD> I'll repeat myself http://i.imgur.com/8VVl6.jpg
01:50:28 <AmandaS4ys> i think he needs money guyz
01:50:50 <medos> i don't

01:51:22 <AmandaS4ys> interesting
01:51:30 <AmandaS4ys> kind of like a brainstorming thing?
01:51:48 <medos> sprint backlogs aren't realllllllly related to gantt
01:52:04 <medos> but one "time block" of a gant chart could be compared to a sprint backlog
01:52:13 <AmandaS4ys> ahh i see
01:52:28 <medos> where stuff has to get done and team members get fixed assignments to finish
01:52:34 <TheWhisper> wait
01:52:36 <TheWhisper> Oh
01:52:44 <TheWhisper> You actually have to do a gantt chat
01:52:45 <TheWhisper> lol

02:16:44 <TheWhisper> (Which is it now)
02:16:49 <TheWhisper> and the longer one would've been like 60

02:47:43 <EDSGD> zakmac thanks for the recommendation.
02:47:55 <EDSGD> sounds great TheWhisper keep it up.
02:48:18 <zakmac> If there was a way I'd send it to you right now
02:48:29 <TheWhisper> edsgd keep what up
02:48:30 <TheWhisper> oh
02:48:32 <TheWhisper> productivity
02:48:35 <zakmac> Went in with semi-low expectations, left needing to watch it over again almost immediately
02:48:37 <EDSGD> Yes.
02:48:46 <TheWhisper> zakmac, designed anything recently?
02:48:53 <EDSGD> Not with my crap internet.
02:49:04 <EDSGD> its like having dial-up again.
02:49:16 <zakmac> Working on 5 Minute Mystery. That was my weekend project to wrap it up but I'm a lazy asshole
02:49:44 <EDSGD> This is not regarding the site right? Thought you finished it.
02:49:49 <zakmac> That screen cap I sent you was my maintained speed, it's the 3.4 it peaked at that I missed which inspired me to snapshot it
02:50:13 <TheWhisper> Oh lol
02:50:16 <TheWhisper> Well done then :P
02:50:24 <zakmac> EDSGD the design yes, btu there's 55^10 pages that all need coded and the developer is impossible to motivate so everything falls onto me
02:50:42 <EDSGD> FIRE HIM!
02:51:13 <zakmac> Not possible or I would. Plus for some reason reliable php guys are impossible to come by, especially whom are local
02:51:40 <zakmac> Regardless, its his site and he wants it revamped but would prefer no effort on his own part
02:52:23 <zakmac> Anybody know a good private tracker besides IPTorrents? I even have an invite to trade
02:53:07 <EDSGD> Do you know of a site as good as Demonoid? 
02:53:19 <EDSGD> Everything I ever searched for was always there
02:53:21 <zakmac> Demonoid wasn't exactly good, just vast
02:53:26 <EDSGD> exactly
02:53:29 <TheWhisper> thearrowflies has torrent sites
02:53:35 <TheWhisper> but you need a great ratio i think
02:53:38 <zakmac> IPTorrents is close in terms of breadth of content, but still no demonoid
02:53:38 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/7D9SS.png <- button style?
02:53:45 <EDSGD> LOL I can't get it then. 
02:53:52 <EDSGD> I'm one of those bastard leechers

02:53:55 <TheWhisper> medos ew
02:54:01 <medos> LELELELE
02:54:05 <zakmac> My ratios are usually >3.5
02:54:09 <TheWhisper> I hope that wasn't serious
02:54:11 <TheWhisper> because 
02:54:14 <TheWhisper> please no
02:54:16 <TheWhisper> ;(
02:54:23 <medos> wait
02:54:25 <TheWhisper> zakmac message thearrowflies then
02:54:27 <medos> nvm
02:54:30 <TheWhisper> lol
02:54:31 <medos> maybe
02:54:31 <EDSGD> Looks nice medos, but I don't think it would work for fridgepal

02:54:44 <TheWhisper> 1) impossibru shado
02:54:44 <medos> yupyup
02:54:46 <zakmac> Demonoid I was at something like a six due to years of just running a shitty old pc at home that was practically a Drobo with uTorrent
02:54:47 <TheWhisper> 2) not fridgey
02:55:33 <EDSGD> great list of crap though.
02:55:39 <EDSGD> :p

03:12:31 <EDSGD> HAH
03:12:45 <zakmac> Who on earth would think that's even useful?
03:13:11 <medos> it's fun
03:13:23 <zakmac> fun != useful
03:14:01 <medos> i just advertised a pdf-reader due to one hilarious feature
03:14:14 <medos> good marketing
03:14:34 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/YVbOY.png <- there's also this less bulgey mode which might make more sense
03:14:46 <zakmac> Good marketing would be you remarking how incredible the zoom is. Not it being a quirky useless gimmick :)
03:15:01 <zakmac> Much better, still oddball
03:15:11 <medos> you have to see it live to experience the fun!
03:15:28 <zakmac> Perhaps I'm just an old grump

20:29:45 <TheWhisper> Do you have a site?
20:29:52 <Matt3000> mattvona.com
20:30:06 <Matt3000> it was a little slow though earlier. Is it slow for you?
20:31:35 <TheWhisper> uh
20:31:37 <TheWhisper> a bit
20:31:58 <Matt3000> I have to contact fatcow. Or it could be wordpress freaking out.

20:34:19 <Matt3000> Thank you!
20:35:31 <TheWhisper> lol
20:35:33 <TheWhisper> np
20:36:14 <Matt3000> I wanted an opinion on this. I'm working with a game dev team. Any thoughts?
20:36:15 <Matt3000> http://i.imgur.com/uVzOV.jpg
20:36:52 <Matt3000> Its just "concept" art I guess. But when I actually start creating the backgrounds for the games, I felt like I should be prepared.
20:37:09 <TheWhisper> hm
20:37:15 <TheWhisper> Space game?
20:37:22 <Matt3000> haha
20:37:28 <Matt3000> Possibly!
20:37:33 <TheWhisper> I mean
20:37:39 <TheWhisper> As space art, it looks pretty sick
20:37:53 <TheWhisper> Maybe a little too 'photoshop rendered clouds' though
20:38:03 <TheWhisper> Cuz I know you used the render > clouds ;)
20:38:08 <Matt3000> hehe
20:38:11 <Matt3000> Yeah. 
20:38:19 <Matt3000> I wonder if there's a better way to do that.
20:38:30 <TheWhisper> I have a ton of space tutorials
20:38:35 <TheWhisper> from when I used to want to do that :P

20:52:13 <TheWhisper> I dunno
20:52:18 <TheWhisper> I don't like things like this
20:52:24 <TheWhisper> because the perspective makes me want to kill people
20:52:31 <TheWhisper> or rather, lack of perspective
20:52:39 <TheWhisper> and boxiness
20:52:41 <TheWhisper> ll

21:15:48 <TheWhisper> http://goo.gl/IEUyy
21:16:05 <marshmallow> oh, true
21:17:16 <Matt3000> I made a lens like that for my school organization I was in, http://www.temple.edu/students/tfc/images/tfclogo.png
21:19:03 <marshmallow> you have no rainbow too XD
21:20:48 <TheWhisper> LOL
21:21:39 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/waw4d.png
21:21:45 <TheWhisper> Can't believe no one noticed that
21:22:04 <marshmallow> xd
21:22:17 <marshmallow> somebody didn't proofread
21:24:34 <Matt3000> Well, our brains don't usually respond to double words. So its understandable. But I mean, if 1,000 people read it, one of them is bound to pick up the mistake.
21:24:53 <Matt3000> ANd I didnt have the rainbow because I wasn't going for accuracy. There's actually a warped world map.
21:25:12 <TheWhisper> Normal people's brains don't respond to to double words, you mean.
21:25:29 <Matt3000> haha
21:25:30 <TheWhisper> Smart people, like me, can can see them just fine.
21:25:32 <TheWhisper> damn

21:26:31 <TheWhisper> lol
21:26:54 <TheWhisper> I'm just a good proofreader though.
21:27:08 <Matt3000> yeah, I gues it depends on the person.
21:27:35 <marshmallow> okies, i'm out for the day
21:27:44 <Matt3000> cya
21:27:44 <marshmallow> i'll look into this rainbow stuff tomorrow.
21:27:47 <marshmallow> lol.  bye
21:35:58 <TheWhisper> zakmac, are you working?
21:36:08 <zakmac> What's up?
21:36:26 <TheWhisper> Wondering if you're working :P
21:43:32 <zakmac> Yes, currently at work
21:43:45 <TheWhisper> Oh lol
21:43:51 <TheWhisper> I'll leave you be then
21:44:00 <zakmac> Trying to figure out this shopping cart system and hoping there's an FTP account to edit template files :\
21:44:24 <TheWhisper> Ah haha that's not fun
21:44:39 <zakmac> Nah, this job is much more relaxed than my last so I have time to talk as the work is much easier and the boss isn't an overbearing jerk so long as my things get finished
21:45:04 <TheWhisper> Oh, that's legit
21:45:10 <TheWhisper> Btw, redesign their site ;)
21:46:46 <TheWhisper> Bah
21:46:51 <TheWhisper> I wish i had like 5 more hours to sketch
21:47:01 <TheWhisper> I've only done 2 pages so far
21:50:07 <zakmac> Good sketches or those self-blowjob type of sloppy-yet-could-be-cool action poses/eyes/low res faces?
21:50:24 <zakmac> I hate how every "artsy sketch" looks the same because its easy and lazy
21:50:50 <zakmac> Not to get down on you if you happen to fall into that category since most everyone does without thinking about it
21:50:52 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/RqkTd.jpg
21:51:00 <zakmac> Ah, pretty
21:51:01 <TheWhisper> lol
21:51:13 <TheWhisper> It's for a redesign of www.thefallworkshop.com
21:51:14 <Matt3000> haha simple!
21:51:19 <TheWhisper> I want to focus on the images
21:51:20 <zakmac> You could use some handwriting help though
21:51:25 <TheWhisper> :P
21:51:35 <TheWhisper> I need to get letter stencils, I think
21:51:55 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/A1tvR.jpg is the rough map I was thinking
21:52:10 <zakmac> Nah, just better handwriting. Write smaller for starters, that'll help 
21:52:14 <TheWhisper> essentially, the homepge is the top left
21:52:17 <TheWhisper> *homepage
21:52:24 <zakmac> You lefty?
21:52:26 <TheWhisper> then you go down to the middle left page
21:52:26 <TheWhisper> yes
21:52:35 <zakmac> Thought so
21:52:44 <TheWhisper> You can see the smudges? ;)
21:52:49 <TheWhisper> Anyway, you go down to the middle left page
21:52:52 <TheWhisper> and select a story
21:52:59 <TheWhisper> and then that brings you to the right pages
21:53:01 <zakmac> No, the slant of your letters and how your S and Y hook
21:53:04 <TheWhisper> ah
21:53:28 <TheWhisper> I can write neater, I just tend to do messy sketches 
21:53:32 <TheWhisper> anyway
21:53:34 <TheWhisper> you go to the story
21:53:36 <TheWhisper> and if you go down
21:53:40 <TheWhisper> it goes through the photos in that story
21:53:43 <TheWhisper> or if you go right
21:53:45 <TheWhisper> it goes to the next story
21:53:56 <TheWhisper> and if you're at say story 1, photo 5
21:53:56 <zakmac> I follow
21:53:58 <TheWhisper> and you go right
21:54:02 <TheWhisper> it takes you to story 2, photo 1
21:54:12 <zakmac> Not too shabby
21:54:20 <zakmac> 8==D~
21:54:20 <TheWhisper> I sent it to medos earlier
21:54:26 <TheWhisper> and he never replied ;(
21:54:29 <zakmac> I give you a x2 splurgy boner
21:54:32 <TheWhisper> So I guess that means he couldn't find anything wrong with it
21:54:33 <TheWhisper> haha
21:54:34 <TheWhisper> nice
21:54:57 <zakmac> Back shortly, chip run time
21:55:11 <TheWhisper> http://bartaz.github.com/impress.js/#/bored I was thinking we could use this for it
21:55:12 <TheWhisper> somehow
21:55:17 <TheWhisper> but I dunno if it would work
21:56:17 <Matt3000> That site was so much fun.
