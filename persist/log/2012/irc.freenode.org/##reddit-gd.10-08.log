02:16:02 <EDSGD> Are  you going to write some feedback?
02:16:28 <medos> nope, not while being uncertain
02:16:38 <medos> if you were kidding with your meta-amusement-joking
02:17:00 <medos> tl;dr: not sure if you thought it's funny because it's helv bl cn
02:17:12 <medos> or because it's a cheap free edit you know from dafont
02:17:59 <EDSGD> .u meta
02:18:09 <EDSGD> hmmmm
02:18:29 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/QcbXw.png

02:18:43 <medos> i'm not sure if you were serious
02:18:50 <EDSGD> Oh not that.
02:19:01 <medos> because it's either helvetica neue condensed black with raised stems on two letters
02:19:23 <medos> or one of those helvetikarps-neue on dafont
02:19:27 <EDSGD> I was referring to the one with the Arrow on the letter 'U'.
02:19:40 <medos> ah
02:19:45 <EDSGD> I should have been a bit more clear. 
02:20:26 <EDSGD> I should always be a bit more clear. I have a terrible habit of leaving things out and then you have to fill in the gaps.
02:20:28 <EDSGD> Sorry.
02:20:53 <medos> lol
02:21:10 <medos> are you drunk? :D
02:21:41 <TheWhisper> lol

02:29:28 <medos> it's a fucking amazing movie
02:29:31 <TheWhisper> Don't judge a person with leprosy by their lack of limbs

09:44:09 <thejoot> hi
09:44:38 <thejoot> anything happening here?
09:45:27 <medos> sure
09:45:43 <medos> most people are still asleep, i'm one of the few europeans in here ;)
09:45:59 <medos> what's up thejoot ?
09:46:30 <thejoot> well not alot ,was just browsing reddit then noticed gd had a chatroom.
09:46:38 <thejoot> thought i would poke my head in and say hi
09:47:00 <medos> yeah, we do
09:47:07 <medos> quite active even, hi ;)
09:48:07 <medos> professional, freelancer, hobbyist?
09:48:11 <medos> or student?
09:48:52 <thejoot> professional, and freelancer
09:49:04 <thejoot> day job then my own company outside of that
09:49:33 <medos> sounds awesome, what's your focus?
09:49:37 <thejoot> How about you?
09:49:49 <medos> I'm freelancing, trying to take life not so seriously
09:50:35 <medos> works out well for the most part, i'm still recovering from 4 years of newspaper design work where i nudged frutiger around in black and white advertisements
09:50:42 <thejoot> Well right now I'm just trying to get my own company know and generate clients, it hard. My main focus would probably be branding and advertising. But i do try and do it all, websites etc
09:50:52 <medos> ah
09:51:02 <medos> got a website/portfolio to show?
09:51:40 <thejoot> you could go check out my website and facebook page, i have a behance too. The problem I find is getting enough time to build my own portfolio while also having a full time job
09:52:01 <thejoot> www.facebook.com/digitallyroasted                www.digitallyroasted.co.uk    
09:52:23 <thejoot> Your nice and chatty to come into a irc with.
09:52:41 <thejoot> makes a great deal of difference to cold welcomes
09:53:03 <medos> It's my life's mission to take care of this chatroom, I'm the guy who started it after all
09:53:27 <medos> <- champ-ooh on reddit
09:54:05 <thejoot> ah, ok hiya :)
09:54:11 <medos> Nice, I like your site, looks clean and neat
09:54:19 <thejoot> do you have a portfolio?
09:54:51 <thejoot> ah my behance
09:54:54 <thejoot> http://be.net/digitallyroasted
09:54:56 <medos> I'll just link my stuff, then go for a smoke and then i'll be back in 5 minutes ;)
09:55:23 <medos> http://champ-ooh.minus.com/muCmRzAcm <- a random pile of stuff
09:55:37 <thejoot> Oh really :) im glad you like the site! I think some feedback from peopel i have had is that the clean clear design is too dull. I dont think so personally, but really my site should be for clients not my taste
09:55:39 <medos> http://dribbble.com/MichaelBuck
09:55:53 <medos> true
09:56:00 <medos> i'll be right back, smoke time :)
09:59:21 <medos> so
09:59:26 <medos> back!
09:59:38 <medos> time to take a look at both behance and your site some more
10:03:50 <medos> your logo development stuff is well executed, it feels to me like you're hiding them a bit on your website
10:04:22 <medos> (i hope my random design-dump didn't confuse you!)
10:06:21 <medos> also: i like your site, if you like your site you will attract clients that like your site, sticking to this style is better than switching it up and having clients expect something entirely different
10:12:09 <thejoot> hey champ, sorry i went for a break too
10:12:52 <thejoot> Yes, my website needs attention, i know this its just finding the time to do it, i find the facebook page and behance so much easier to update.
10:13:17 <thejoot> love all your stuff. Not confusing at all, just a pleasure to scroll through
10:13:56 <medos> thank you :)
10:14:09 <thejoot> ?challenge
10:14:43 <medos> that's our friendly neighbourhood all-knowing irc-bot :)
10:15:04 <thejoot> :)
10:15:30 <thejoot> Yeah i really like some of the fractured sharp designs you have.
10:15:43 <thejoot> all in all I really like your stuff champ
10:16:02 <medos> thank you!
10:16:26 <medos> i somehow feel it's better to just present a huuuuge wall of stuff
10:16:47 <medos> no one ever has the will to pick on a single piece ;)
10:18:08 <thejoot> awesome   http://champ-ooh.minus.com/lBMimICes3uJX
10:18:23 <thejoot> yeah i know right! i cant pick things for shit
10:18:47 <thejoot> when does the challenge need to be done by?
10:19:19 <medos> it kind of expired recently, the prior challenges were interesting
10:19:31 <medos> now it somehow dwindled down, barely any participation
10:20:38 <medos> if you want to you can still participate
10:21:41 <medos> i'll just need to figure out some way to make it interesting again
10:22:04 <thejoot> i may do, seems like i dont have time for the other 101 things i need/want to do atm tho
10:24:08 <medos> yeah, the challenge system doesn't really have any winner or loser
10:24:25 <medos> it's more about doing something and look at results
10:24:54 <thejoot> yeah i like that though, just a mish mash of ideas and thoughts
10:26:10 <medos> i might just ban challenges for a month, then it'll be interesting again
10:26:52 <medos> anyway, I have some stuff to finish, will occasionally alt+tab when i want to evade work
10:27:06 <medos> most designer guys in here show up in 1-3 hours

10:29:46 <thejoot_> chrome crashed while uploading to boxnet.....
10:30:21 <medos> grab canary
10:30:24 <medos> or chromium
10:30:32 <medos> or make a second chrome user profile
10:30:43 <medos> to split tasks :)
10:32:31 <thejoot_> canary? whats that
10:33:02 <medos> .g chrome canary
10:33:40 <thejoot_> downloading now
10:33:56 <medos> in the end it's just chrome
10:34:43 <medos> but having a second chrome running for one task that is important is better than having 20 tabs and one of those uploads
10:36:35 <thejoot_> idd!
10:39:50 <thejoot_> so what you doing today? Got any good jobs on?
10:41:08 <medos> making a storyboard for a web video which will be full of vector stuff i make (probably)
10:41:14 <medos> making an app icon for ios
10:41:22 <medos> what else
10:41:25 <medos> some wordpress stuff
10:43:41 <medos> sorry for making it sound dull but most stuff i work on gets tweaked and changed till my head spins ;)
10:44:40 <medos> what about you?
10:45:11 <thejoot_> cool, is this all client stuff or personal things?
10:45:53 <medos> client
10:46:08 <thejoot_> thats good :) glad you have the work
10:48:25 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/NOPzD.png <- personal thing i started this weekend
10:49:38 <thejoot_> i would so wanna go and make it in maya or something, what is it for?
10:50:06 <medos> shading exercise
10:50:13 <medos> and a laptop i like
10:50:14 <medos> ;)
10:54:40 <medos> it's something that will go in my huge pile of stuff that one day will be useful
10:54:55 <medos> either because i learned something while making it or because it'll have actual use
10:54:59 <thejoot_> and even if never used it still work done!
10:56:49 <medos> true :)
10:56:53 <medos> what's your mission?
11:08:43 <thejoot_> today?
11:09:53 <medos> yeah
11:12:52 <thejoot_> well, i have some designs for a new company that make cat scratchers, lol. They liked my initial ideas and want 4 different images and are paying £60 for each one. I cant do it at work so I guess its going to have to be a late night job once i get home.
11:13:56 <thejoot_> between now and 5pm though, im not sure, i have lots of stuff to do but i think the first bit will be an html email that someone here needs
11:21:43 <medos> aaaah
11:21:44 <medos> test
11:22:23 <thejoot_> test 
11:22:30 <thejoot_> icle?
11:22:44 <thejoot_> sorry was away form the chat for a little while
11:24:45 <medos> that's the norm
11:25:17 <medos> I just killed my chatlog in every window by accident
11:33:18 <TheWhisper> Damn, it's cold

16:43:09 <marshmallow_> yea, definitely coke
16:43:58 <TheWhisper> ugh
16:44:04 <TheWhisper> I like eating carrots
16:44:11 <TheWhisper> but I always get pieces in my nose
16:44:31 <TheWhisper> (that sounds weird, but it's cuz I breath when I eat sometimes, which makes me cough)
16:44:58 <marshmallow_> so, can't eat and breathe at the same time?  =p
16:45:18 <TheWhisper> Nope
16:45:24 <TheWhisper> I have acid reflux
16:45:27 <TheWhisper> so when I eat
16:45:44 <TheWhisper> sometimes I get the feeling of being short of breath (not actually short of breath though)
16:45:49 <TheWhisper> so I automatically take deep breaths
16:46:04 <TheWhisper> and then carrot pieces get sucked down my throat
16:46:08 <TheWhisper> and coughed back up into my nose
16:46:08 <TheWhisper> lol
16:51:38 <TheWhisper> ugh
16:51:42 <TheWhisper> Why are all good foods acidic :(
16:51:53 <TheWhisper> zakmac, what do you know about alkaline vs acidic diets?
16:52:56 <zakmac> All I really know is balance is key because if you go too far in one pH direction you're setting the body up for bad times
16:54:06 <TheWhisper> Hm
16:54:34 <TheWhisper> I'm trying to figure out about how to get the most effect from my adderall
16:54:48 <zakmac> Follow r/trees example and eat mango
16:54:54 <TheWhisper> and places say a that a high alkaline level increases absorption
16:55:23 <TheWhisper> oh whoa
16:55:29 <TheWhisper> There's n #/r/adhd
16:55:39 <zakmac> I don't think that's accurate. Proper balance of alkalines/acids is what allows for best absorption of nutrients
16:55:47 <zakmac> r/pillpoppers
16:56:32 <zakmac> When I was on adderall I just took as prescribed without worrying and about a week in there was a noticeable difference in my focus
16:56:43 <TheWhisper> I have a noticeable difference
16:56:47 <TheWhisper> but it also varies from day to do
16:56:49 <TheWhisper> *day
16:56:55 <TheWhisper> and i think some of that could be because of my diet
16:58:08 <TheWhisper> "s a result of its high bioavailability, Adderall XR's effectiveness is not altered by food absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. " interesting

19:23:11 <TheWhisper> Oh, I thought you made that
19:23:14 <TheWhisper> I was gonna make fun of your name
19:23:25 <TheWhisper> Konstantin is actually a sick name though
19:23:45 <marshmallow> sounds male..
19:23:48 <marshmallow> just saying XD
19:23:53 <iasmatt> yeah who want to make fun of dat(z)

19:31:31 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/rUloz.png god dammit
19:31:41 <TheWhisper> Ha, that's clever
19:33:46 <marshmallow> http://dribbble.com/shots/260375-Lonely-Traveller <-- cute cute!
19:35:56 <marshmallow> gar, I wish I could dislike stuff on dribbble
19:36:08 <marshmallow> i hate all these posts of like 1/12 of a poster
19:36:14 <marshmallow> and no shot of the full poster =(
19:38:04 <TheWhisper> Lol
19:38:12 <TheWhisper> That's not the purpose of it :P
19:38:26 <TheWhisper> "share small screenshots that show their work, process, and current projects."
19:41:25 <marshmallow> then don't tag it as a poster!
19:41:38 <marshmallow> if you won't show the poster
19:41:39 <marshmallow> gah
19:42:41 <TheWhisper> lo

20:00:34 <marshmallow> hi hi
20:00:50 <Dekthro> SUP GUYS
20:01:11 <TheWhisper> Hi Dekthro
20:01:51 <Dekthro> How goes it
20:02:49 <TheWhisper> It goes :P
20:03:19 <Dekthro> Well good, I'm glad
20:04:35 <TheWhisper> And you? Student, freelancer, pro?
20:06:38 <Dekthro> Drop out that got lucky and designs vehicle wraps/signs
20:07:40 <TheWhisper> Sounds cool. Got a site?
20:07:59 <Dekthro> Was just doing community college/general ed stuff anyways
20:08:14 <Dekthro> I do, but it doesn't really have much at all. Haven't updated it since last December, haha
20:08:45 <TheWhisper> Ah, no worries. I won't judge it too harshly :P
20:09:02 <Dekthro> Haha
20:09:05 <Dekthro> http://derekhighet.com/
20:09:21 <Dekthro> It only has the first two wraps that I've done
20:09:26 <TheWhisper> High ET
20:09:27 <TheWhisper> lol
20:09:46 <TheWhisper> Hm
20:09:49 <TheWhisper> Interesting layout
20:10:12 <TheWhisper> Do you like doing wraps?
20:10:20 <Dekthro> Yeah it needs work, but I haven't done any web work since I started here
20:10:34 <Dekthro> Yeah its crazy
20:10:42 <TheWhisper> Ooh, I like the feed me guy
20:10:52 <TheWhisper> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQVB-SbzJI
20:10:54 <TheWhisper> :P
20:12:01 <Dekthro> Yeah I love Jon Gooch's work, but he didn't have any posters for purchase
20:12:10 <Dekthro> So I had to recreate it so I could print my own
20:13:21 <TheWhisper> Interesting logo for bipolar stability
20:13:39 <TheWhisper> The eyes on it are in a weird place
20:13:42 <TheWhisper> but it's cool
20:13:48 <Dekthro> Yeah I had fun with that one
20:13:58 <Dekthro> Obvious inspiration from Jon there heh
20:14:17 <TheWhisper> Jon?
20:14:21 <TheWhisper> Also, you've got some cool stuff
20:14:26 <marshmallow> cool stuff bro
20:14:27 <marshmallow> =D
20:14:32 <medos> indeed
20:14:38 <Dekthro> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Gooch
20:14:44 <TheWhisper> I'm not sure I would like doing wraps all day
20:14:51 <TheWhisper> as I feel like they'd need to be flashy
20:15:04 <Dekthro> The "Feed Me" guy. Music producer and illustrates all his own albums/merch etc
20:15:06 <TheWhisper> Ah
20:15:16 <marshmallow> the dimensions/resolutions alone would confuse me if I had to do wraps
20:15:20 <TheWhisper> Lol
20:15:26 <Dekthro> It's a little daunting at first
20:15:34 <TheWhisper> Well, can't be much different than doing packaging, right?
20:15:42 <TheWhisper> At least in terms of laying out the sizes
20:15:43 <medos> spor :O
20:15:46 <Dekthro> Maybe? Hah
20:15:53 <Dekthro> Yeah he was also Spor
20:15:53 <TheWhisper> :P
20:16:38 <Dekthro> I haven't done any packaging design
20:17:43 <Dekthro> Figures Imgur was down. I was going to upload more pics....
20:17:56 <medos> there's minus.com
20:18:10 <medos> as an alternative
20:18:26 <medos> not really as private though, every upload is publicly visible
20:18:49 <marshmallow> medos, what's the command to tell Awesomius to tell me links to stuff ya told it to remember?
20:18:55 <Dekthro> Now that I do design 40 hours a week, the last thing I want to do is work on my own personal site
20:19:03 <marshmallow> lol
20:19:19 <TheWhisper> ?psd
20:19:30 <TheWhisper> marshmallow ^
20:19:37 <Dekthro> minus similar to dribbble?
20:19:49 <TheWhisper> Minus is similar to Imgur
20:19:59 <medos> 10 gigs of space if you sign up
20:20:09 <medos> upload like a madman
20:20:10 <marshmallow> (is there a ?text link?)
20:20:17 <Dekthro> Haha
20:20:33 <medos> it's down sometimes as well and a little slower than imgur
20:20:37 <Dekthro> Speaking of Dribbble, would that be a good alternative?
20:20:39 <medos> but no image resizing
20:20:46 <medos> for what? imgur?
20:20:55 <TheWhisper> Dribble is more like
20:20:59 <TheWhisper> half of a portfolio
20:20:59 <Dekthro> Just to show work
20:21:09 <medos> show work in progress stuff
20:21:18 <TheWhisper> Dribbble's really sort of weird imo
20:21:23 <Dekthro> Yeah
20:21:31 <TheWhisper> It doesn't even seem to me like most people post valuable crit
20:21:47 <medos> meh
20:21:50 <TheWhisper> So essentially you're just saying "here is a piece of something i'm doing on - comment on it saying it's nice, or else just ignore it"
20:22:00 <TheWhisper> *working on (not doing on
20:22:01 <Dekthro> Yeah
20:22:02 <TheWhisper> )
20:22:14 <Dekthro> I've seen a lot of each (in progress/finished)
20:22:22 <marshmallow> <@TheWhisper> half of a portfolio <-- not even half.  More like 1/12!
20:22:26 <medos> Be explicit about feedback
20:22:26 <medos> If you want feedback on your shots, explain your work and what type of feedback you’re looking for. Don’t just post a shot without comment and expect to get comments back.
20:22:37 <marshmallow> dribbble has been teasing me all day.  =/
20:22:40 <medos> player's handbook
20:23:47 <medos> most people don't post crit because crit is by default not welcome there
20:24:00 <TheWhisper> Well, it's be default dumb then :P
20:24:03 <TheWhisper> Crit should always be welcome
20:24:06 <TheWhisper> *by
20:24:07 <medos> no
20:24:09 <TheWhisper> yes
20:24:10 <medos> tbh.
20:24:14 <medos> just no?
20:24:20 <medos> well you're never doing anything
20:24:22 <TheWhisper> I agree to disagree.
20:24:23 <medos> so it's obvious
20:24:25 <medos> ;)
20:24:27 <TheWhisper> Hey, I'm doing stuff!
20:24:32 <marshmallow> yay!
20:24:41 <TheWhisper> just not good stuff lol
20:24:41 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/zyRc6.jpg
20:24:55 <medos> not going to crit that one
20:25:05 <Dekthro> Hmm looks like you're not even allowed to start posting with Dribbble right away anyways
20:25:12 <medos> oh
20:25:12 <TheWhisper> Wasn't asking you to, medos :P
20:25:20 <medos> TheWhisper no shit?
20:25:21 <medos> :P
20:25:26 <TheWhisper> Didn't say you couldn't though
20:25:29 <TheWhisper> Just wasn't asking :P
20:25:36 <medos> Dekthro it's not that easy to get into dribbble
20:25:50 <medos> on, with in? drafted?
20:25:51 <TheWhisper> One does not simply walk into Dribbble
20:26:00 <Dekthro> Yeah i see now it's kind of a clique
20:26:01 <Dekthro> lol
20:26:22 <medos> http://www.reddit.com/search?q=dribbble+invite&restrict_sr=off&sort=relevance
20:26:27 <Dekthro> 'I do not have time for this!
20:26:49 <medos> to be fair it's easier if you focus on getting better instead of begging for invites
20:27:00 <medos> makes invites come easier
20:27:12 <medos> ?portfolio
20:27:23 <TheWhisper> Pfft
20:27:27 <TheWhisper> Getting better is pointless
20:27:32 <TheWhisper> if I can't dribbble the process!
20:27:34 <TheWhisper> ;)
20:27:36 <Dekthro> Haha
20:27:37 <marshmallow> LOL
20:28:26 <marshmallow> i have a love / hate relationship with dribbble.  Post like these: http://dribbble.com/shots/133268-4th-Anniversary that show only a bit and not the full thing are really annoying me 
20:28:47 <medos> imma make one of those next
20:29:03 <marshmallow> >=o
20:29:11 <TheWhisper> Marshmallow, so you essentially /do not like the concept of dribble/
20:29:27 <marshmallow> well, they should show me a follow up post =D
20:29:32 <marshmallow> so I can see the whole thing =D
20:29:36 <marshmallow> not tease me =(
20:29:53 <TheWhisper> People who have accounts and can post can view follow up posts ;)
20:30:21 <TheWhisper> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/270523/graphicDesignPortfolio.pdf wtf is happening there
20:30:22 <TheWhisper> weird
20:30:28 <TheWhisper> Don't look if you're sensitive to weird shit
20:30:41 <medos> Dekthro did you sign up on dribbble?
20:30:50 <marshmallow> is that link SFW?
20:30:50 <medos> might as well link your account so i can follow ya
20:31:10 <TheWhisper> Yes, it's sfw
20:31:31 <TheWhisper> aw

20:31:40 <TheWhisper> now I feel bad for criticizing his portfolio lol
20:31:43 <medos> what's with you
20:31:44 <TheWhisper> wait
20:31:46 <medos> seriously
20:31:47 <Dekthro> Medos I do have an account
20:31:49 <TheWhisper> Didn't he come in here?
20:31:55 <Dekthro> I'm still a 'prospect'
20:32:06 <TheWhisper> Whoops, and I'm drifting. 
20:32:06 <medos> i can follow you even when you're a prospect
20:32:45 <Dekthro> http://dribbble.com/dhighet
20:33:00 <medos> k cool
20:33:52 <marshmallow> i'm still a prospect too =p
20:34:11 <Dekthro> http://minus.com/mbhLQ0Mwh4cJ9l alright dumped some photos
20:34:31 <Dekthro> I'm not the amazing photographer, its typically our receptionist or installer
20:34:33 <marshmallow> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/270523/graphicDesignPortfolio.pdf <-- whose is this stuff?  Seems HUGE for a portfolio...
20:34:41 <medos> holy shit
20:35:18 <medos> that's some pretty impressive complex stuff
20:35:49 <TheWhisper> Marshmallow, I linked a reddit post by him ^
20:36:14 <medos> *you stalked him
20:36:28 <TheWhisper> Potato tomato
20:36:54 <TheWhisper> Dekthro, do you ever feel like you have to make them really flashy and complex, even when it could work as a simpler design?
20:37:05 <medos> Dekthro those are all awesome
20:37:29 <medos> i like the popcorn one the most
20:37:33 <medos> i think
20:37:54 <TheWhisper> I like the College Options one a lot
20:38:09 <TheWhisper> Or the Hawaiian Ice Cream Truck lol
20:38:14 <Dekthro> It's weird. When I do the first proof, I just go with what I feel about the project (based on input from the customer ofcourse, if provided). And I have tried more simple designs
20:38:19 <Dekthro> but usually they don't end up liking it
20:38:24 <Dekthro> or something to that effect
20:38:30 <TheWhisper> Yeah, customers never do :P
20:38:40 <TheWhisper> Ooh, forge's glass is cool on a close up
20:38:46 <TheWhisper> Not really a fan of the collision center pickup
20:38:53 <Dekthro> Yeah I was pissed that no one took photos of the front/back.,..
20:39:01 <TheWhisper> Of which one?
20:39:04 <Dekthro> George
20:39:10 <TheWhisper> Ah
20:39:14 <TheWhisper> OH LOL
20:39:22 <TheWhisper> I read it as forge's glass
20:39:24 <Dekthro> Hilds was supposed to be a wrap, but the guy got his damn vehicle painter involved and the design kept getting worse an worse
20:39:25 <TheWhisper> Did you make their logo too?
20:39:34 <Dekthro> (vehicle painter or whatever)
20:39:38 <Dekthro> No it was theirs
20:39:41 <TheWhisper> Okay  good
20:39:43 <TheWhisper> It's a shitty logo
20:39:46 <TheWhisper> :P
20:39:46 <Dekthro> Hahaha
20:40:01 <TheWhisper> The G doesn't read as being part of eorge at all
20:40:27 <Dekthro> It almost seems like Glass shouldn't have a G
20:40:32 <Dekthro> If you're doign it like that
20:40:43 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/8NzlH.png
20:40:45 <TheWhisper> Yeah
20:40:50 <TheWhisper> Eorge's Lass!
20:41:05 <Dekthro> The window break?
20:41:10 <TheWhisper> ?
20:41:16 <Dekthro> The picture you linked
20:41:23 <TheWhisper> go look :P
20:41:43 <Dekthro> Is this where I say "soon"?
20:41:48 <TheWhisper> :
20:41:50 <TheWhisper> * :D
20:41:53 <TheWhisper> I cannot type right now
20:41:54 <Dekthro> lol
20:43:11 <Dekthro> Anyone know of a good resource for learning to write scripts for Illustrator?
20:43:32 <medos> not sure but let's team up
20:43:41 <Dekthro> Haha
20:43:42 <medos> what version do you use?
20:43:52 <Dekthro> CS6 at work, CS4 at home :(
20:43:58 <medos> bummer
20:44:04 <medos> cs4 will be easier to write scripts for
20:44:10 <medos> .g scriptographer
20:44:14 <Dekthro> I'm sure I could isntall 6 at home though
20:44:47 <medos> if you want custom scripts, scriptographer is the way to go
20:44:59 <medos> problem is: it does not work with cs6
20:45:14 <Dekthro> Oh well, what I want to write will require it
20:45:25 <Dekthro> Since it would be a script to help with my stuff at work
20:46:23 <medos> http://wwwimages.adobe.com/www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/illustrator/scripting/cs6/Illustrator-Scripting-Guide.pdf
20:47:45 <medos> scriptographer would've been simple javascript stuff
20:47:51 <medos> this is horrifying stuff
20:47:57 <medos> what kind of script are you looking to make?
20:48:24 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/UXvzk.png
20:48:24 <TheWhisper> lol
20:48:26 <TheWhisper> dammit 
20:48:34 <TheWhisper> What are you doing with this text, PS
20:53:26 <Dekthro> I wanted to write a script that would auto place banner grommet markers for our production guys
20:55:09 <medos> hm
20:56:23 <Dekthro> We have some basic templates for the common sizes, which I just drag an drop, but I figured it would be a good project to learn scripting
20:57:11 <TheWhisper> Whoa
20:57:19 <TheWhisper> Linking layers = awesome for moving groups in sync
20:57:21 <medos> random fact coming up
20:57:34 <TheWhisper> Hey, it's relevant :P
20:57:47 <medos> random obvious basic photoshop fact
20:58:06 <TheWhisper> You're talking to the guy who didn't use masks for like 6 years
20:58:15 <TheWhisper> And did everything with just erasing 
20:58:16 <TheWhisper> lol
20:58:19 <medos> Dekthro is there anything tricky aout placement?
20:58:30 <medos> *about
20:58:43 <Dekthro> Just every 2ft~, but ofcourse some sizes wont allow that exactly
21:00:05 -!- iasmatt [~iasmatt@c83-255-4-29.bredband.comhem.se] has left ##reddit-gd
21:01:44 <medos> no idea, i would do this with an offset path dotted stroke
21:02:04 <medos> offset to negative value yadayada
21:03:09 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/wb63B.png

21:09:11 <Dekthro> Hey that's not a bad idea actually
21:09:23 <Dekthro> I would just make a box, and split into a grid
21:09:30 <Dekthro> When I had to make my own that is
21:10:04 <Dekthro> (still want to pursue the script though :P)
21:12:12 <Dekthro> Because I have a lot of other ideas I'd like to make as well. That one was just a starting point
21:13:39 <medos> only idea i would have for illustrator is not to crash all the fucking time
21:13:59 <medos> if i'd be able to write a script to make it not crash i'd be happy
21:14:00 <medos> :D
21:15:15 <Dekthro> Yeahhh...
21:15:19 <Dekthro> Been there...
21:18:36 <TheWhisper> OH 
21:18:41 <TheWhisper> Pixel snapping is only for points
21:18:44 <TheWhisper> I see
21:19:00 <medos> when did you start studying design again?
21:19:03 <medos> 3 years almost?
21:19:14 <medos> lol
21:19:41 <TheWhisper> :P
21:19:48 <TheWhisper> My teachers don't know this shit
21:19:56 <TheWhisper> Which is sad
21:20:05 <TheWhisper> Hey medos, what if I drop out of school
21:20:09 <TheWhisper> and then hire you as my teacher
21:20:16 <TheWhisper> I'll pay you the same cost as my tuition ;)
21:20:19 <Dekthro> I didn't go to school :)
21:20:21 <medos> your parents would be broke
21:20:31 <Dekthro> Which I'm sure is going to bite me in the ass sometime in my life
21:20:41 <medos> Dekthro nah
21:20:43 <TheWhisper> Lol, medos, why would they be broke?
21:21:03 <medos> should work out as long as people are straight forward and tell you what's wrong
21:21:17 <TheWhisper> ^
21:21:22 <medos> TheWhisper i'd have to retire after teaching you
21:21:22 <TheWhisper> School's not all it's cracked up to be
21:21:26 <medos> so $$$$$$
21:21:27 <TheWhisper> Hahaha
21:21:29 <medos> expensive
21:21:38 <TheWhisper> You're saying it would take 40 years to teach me?
21:21:48 <medos> no, i'd be fed up with design though
21:21:54 <TheWhisper> haha
21:22:19 <TheWhisper> :(
21:24:42 <medos> ?looking
21:26:25 <medos> btw. Dekthro if you have any sketches/wip stuff feel free to upload and show that too ;)
21:26:48 <Dekthro> WIP stuff I can't really :\ but personal stuff for sure
21:27:12 <Dekthro> My boss got fucked by an old designer so it was a bit of a struggle to allow showing what I have done
21:27:15 <Dekthro> hah
21:27:41 <marshmallow> <@TheWhisper> I'll pay you the same cost as my tuition ;)  <--  Medos, you would make BANK!  DO ITTTTTTTTtttttttttt.
21:27:54 <marshmallow> (his tuition is 40+K / year)
21:27:55 <TheWhisper> Lol
21:28:14 <medos> yeah i was talking about personal stuff actually
21:30:05 <medos> .g 40000 usd in eur
21:30:55 <Dekthro> Ill do what I can but usually I just go home after work and play Guild Wars 2 all day

21:43:28 <Dekthro> So confused
21:43:45 <medos> i kinda work all day
21:43:48 <medos> :p
21:44:14 <TheWhisper> :P
21:44:27 <Dekthro> Haha
21:45:34 <Dekthro> So in illustrator, I never use layers. Does this make me a terrible person?

21:48:13 <medos> not really
21:48:35 <medos> as everything is still separated as either a group or single piece even if it's just one layer
21:48:52 <medos> also: you wont make people rage who know less about .ai
21:49:01 <medos> but layers are awesomeo
21:49:03 <medos> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/22130024/adobefiles/fucking-027.ai
21:49:08 <medos> hey Kocho :)
21:49:19 <Kocho> Hello Medos. How are you today?
21:49:33 <medos> good :)
21:49:42 <Kocho> That is very good news.
21:49:44 <medos> a little hungry, some stuff to do
21:49:50 <Dekthro> Yeah I just use groups and double click for isolation mode
21:50:05 <Dekthro> But whenever I get provided artwork it's all layered out an crap, and that drives me nuts
21:50:14 <Dekthro> So I figured maybe I'm the backwards one, hah
21:52:55 <medos> layers have a huuuuuuuge advantage
21:52:57 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/6VQn0.png
21:53:10 <medos> outline some
21:53:13 <medos> don't outline others
21:53:19 <medos> i mean outline view
21:53:41 <medos> + you can work on shading on a second layer
21:53:48 <medos> works with groups too though
21:54:13 <medos> Kocho how are you today?
21:54:34 <Kocho> I am very well thank you. I have consumed my breakfast and am ready for the day ahead.
21:54:54 <TheWhisper> Do any of you guys have any good examples of creases/slits?
21:55:03 <medos> .gis creases slits
21:55:12 <medos> lol
21:55:14 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/wk7tq.png is what i've got, but it looks off
21:55:38 <medos> yes
21:56:00 <TheWhisper> ?psd
21:56:12 <Kocho> TheWhisper, I like to do two 1px lines next to each other so it looks beveled.
21:56:23 <TheWhisper> Hm
21:56:47 <medos> 20% white and 60% black 1px line next to each other
21:56:48 <medos> done
21:57:00 <medos> (NOT GREY!!!)
21:58:08 <TheWhisper> But those don't match my base color!
21:58:17 <Kocho> However, the choice is yours TheWhisper and not mine.
22:00:03 <TheWhisper> Wow, medos, that looks sexxy
22:00:06 <TheWhisper> *sexy
22:00:15 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/1BKvD.png
22:00:38 <TheWhisper> Is there any place in particular you got that from?
22:01:11 <Kocho> The ancient Romans did it when they built the pyramids.
22:01:19 <Azra-el> zooming in?
22:01:27 <medos> yup
22:01:31 <medos> zooming in mainly
22:01:44 <medos> and deducting the best possible solution for a problem by toying around with settings
22:01:56 <TheWhisper> Lol
22:02:13 <TheWhisper> I meant like was there a specific psd you took apart for that
22:02:14 <TheWhisper> but okay
22:02:20 <medos> not really
22:02:53 <Kocho> It is quite a common effect used in web design.
22:03:05 <TheWhisper> Yeah, couldn't find a place that had it
22:03:34 <medos> happens when you never do stuff
22:03:49 <TheWhisper> :)
22:04:51 <medos> most people do this by having a white line with 0 size 1px distance angled left drop shadow
22:04:55 <medos> if that's what you want to know
22:05:22 <TheWhisper> If it's 0 size
22:05:26 <Kocho> Yeah, that's the way I do it too
22:05:34 <TheWhisper> huh
22:06:11 <Azra-el> its 0px size but being angled it catched the reflections from the lightsources
22:06:35 <Azra-el> downside is its not usable in the dark
22:06:38 <TheWhisper> Oh, I thought he was saying the line itself was 0 px
22:06:41 <medos> drop shadow = same shape as shape
22:06:49 <medos> size of shadow = amount of blur
22:06:57 <medos> 0 size = drop shadow equals shape
22:07:12 <Azra-el> bah.... my humour is wasted on you ppl ... nonbelievers
22:07:12 <TheWhisper> yeah
22:07:15 <medos> Photoddlershop Tutorial
22:07:21 <Kocho> I agree Azra-el 
22:07:27 <TheWhisper> > white line with 0 size
22:07:44 <Kocho> You aren't a waste though Azra-el.
22:07:54 <Kocho> Don't think you're a waste.
22:08:15 <Azra-el> Kocho.. subtle stuff like that barely graze me :P
22:08:35 <Kocho> ;)
22:08:59 <Azra-el> and medos did a good job of thickening my hide anyway :P
22:10:20 <TheWhisper> Kinky

22:16:40 <TheWhisper> hm gooey
22:17:05 <Kocho> TheWhisper please bare with me as I go to the printing facility and then I will make comment when I have arrived back at my desk. Give me a half an hour please.
22:17:13 <TheWhisper> LOL
22:17:15 <TheWhisper> So formal :P
22:17:27 <TheWhisper> No problemo, my dude. Take your time.
22:17:33 <Azra-el> lol http://youtu.be/i_dEtaNx2Vc
22:17:35 <TheWhisper> Also, I went to the bike story today
22:17:42 <Kocho> I look forward to my constructive criticism.
22:18:19 <TheWhisper> Azra-el, what happened to that shopping thing you were designing
22:18:19 <Azra-el> wind in its sails
22:18:19 <Azra-el> :)
22:18:19 <Kocho> TheWhisper, I also look forward to your bike story which I will also have to delay.
22:18:19 <TheWhisper> k
22:18:19 <TheWhisper> lol
22:18:27 <TheWhisper> Azra-el, does that mean it's dead or taking off
22:18:48 <medos> it's lost at sea is what he means
22:19:12 <Azra-el> that means that right now we're in active development ... and planing a same time launch over a large part of europe .. 
22:19:17 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/L8KgW.png medos
22:19:21 <TheWhisper> I see they do it too
22:19:29 <TheWhisper> Azra-el, show the design :P
22:19:32 <TheWhisper> I haven't seen it in like 2 months
22:20:20 <Azra-el> soon... still havent fixed some stuff that medos will kill me if i show it like it is now :)
22:20:30 <TheWhisper> Aw
22:20:34 <TheWhisper> You can pm it ;)
22:20:47 <Azra-el> i can do you a rotate super pixelated cropped dribble style version of it if you wanna :P
22:21:51 <medos> i don't think you can
22:22:32 <Azra-el> sure i can... just compress it jpeg with 5 quality :P
22:23:08 <Kocho> Neil Armstrong didn't say "I don't think you can" when he asked NASA to build him a space ship to land on the moon.
22:23:55 <TheWhisper> k
22:23:56 <TheWhisper> do it
22:24:11 <TheWhisper> Kocho, sorry that you guys can't see the moon in australia ;(
22:24:12 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/H9rTw.jpg
22:24:15 <TheWhisper> It's pretty cool
22:24:30 <Kocho> We see the moon but it's upside-down.
22:24:37 <TheWhisper> If you see it
22:24:40 <TheWhisper> then how do I also see it?
22:24:49 <TheWhisper> We're on opposite ends of the globe!
22:24:49 <TheWhisper> Unless
22:24:50 <Azra-el> its iMoon
22:24:56 <TheWhisper> THERE ARE TWO MOONS
22:24:58 <TheWhisper> or
22:24:58 <Kocho> Can we discuss this at a later stage?
22:25:03 <TheWhisper> THAT'S NO MOON
22:25:10 <TheWhisper> K
22:25:14 <TheWhisper> Hm
22:25:37 <TheWhisper> What do you guys think of this for dinner: salmon filet with pesto sauce, tortellini, and peas?
22:25:45 <TheWhisper> (for my dinner, not yours)
22:26:29 <Dekthro> Considering I eat hot dogs for dinner
22:26:33 <Dekthro> That sounds just lovely
22:27:22 <Azra-el> i think you're mixing things up for no reason... do a salmon with fried asparagus (in batter) and pesto ... and the other course can be tortellini with bacon bits peas and cream sauce.... 
22:28:48 <Azra-el> (i can vouch for any pasta done with cream sauce bacon and peas.. .its exquisite.. and DOES NOT need the salmon)
22:32:59 <TheWhisper> Hm
22:33:10 <TheWhisper> I love pesto salmon though
22:35:09 <Azra-el> read again the
22:35:11 <Azra-el> n
22:35:17 <Azra-el> do a salmon with fried asparagus (in batter) and pesto
22:38:52 <medos> lol
22:40:03 <Dekthro> Sometimes I treat my self good and make a grilled cheese with ham
22:40:24 <medos> i'm about to eat a sandwich
22:40:27 <Azra-el> poor soul :(
22:40:29 <medos> depending on what's available

22:45:41 <medos> it's me working on my dribbble-shot-skills
22:45:54 <Dekthro> Haha
22:45:55 <medos> does not make sense, might entice people to want more
22:45:59 <Dekthro> Then you did it perfectly
22:46:02 <Dekthro> Yep
22:57:38 <TheWhisper> Medos, I have sculptris

23:00:11 <TheWhisper> Wow
23:00:17 <TheWhisper> My webcam has an even worse camera than my blackberry
23:00:27 <TheWhisper> That's astounding
23:00:47 <TheWhisper> *My webcam is
23:18:21 <medos> is it
23:21:15 <Kocho> TheWhisper I am currently typing an email but send me what you want to show me and I'll comment and take a look in a second.
23:21:35 <TheWhisper> Uh
23:21:39 <TheWhisper> I sent it yesterday
23:22:05 <Kocho> I have messages from the last 1.45 hours.
23:22:07 <medos> aren't you working on it right now?

23:22:55 <TheWhisper> and a different page, medos
23:22:59 <Azra-el> TheWhisper.. no comment .. sorry :(
23:23:08 <TheWhisper> lol okayh
23:23:11 <TheWhisper> *okay
23:23:31 <Azra-el> the thing i suggested is gourmet meal :) this is .... tv dinner :)
23:24:23 <Azra-el> http://dwellingintheword.files.wordpress.com/2010/09/28-salmon.jpg   salmon asparagus
23:24:49 <Azra-el> http://www.kitchenist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/pasta-close.jpg 
23:25:21 <Azra-el> and this is pasta with peas
23:25:46 <Azra-el> better picture http://coutureauchocolat.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/bacon-peas-pasta-carbonara1-590x442.jpg
23:27:46 <TheWhisper> Mine is much tastier than TV
23:27:53 <TheWhisper> Also, i don't like carbonara
23:28:07 <TheWhisper> And I don't give a shit if it looks nice and frou frou
23:28:17 <TheWhisper> :P
23:28:18 <TheWhisper> But
23:28:25 <Kocho> TheWhisper I like what you've done with both pages. They're a lot better than previously. I think you could work on #2 a bit more. I believe some of the orange could contrast a little bit more with other oranges. I'd make the filter text smaller as it has similar hierarchy to the Stories headings. You have to determine which is more important, the stories themselves or how you filter the stories?
23:28:25 <TheWhisper> I will take your suggestions under advisement
23:28:37 <TheWhisper> Hm
23:28:42 <TheWhisper> Okay
23:28:48 <Azra-el> im not talking about LOOKING frou frou TheWhisper ... im talking about taste pairing :)
23:28:51 <TheWhisper> That's a good point abou the stories
23:28:53 <TheWhisper> *about
23:28:56 <TheWhisper> and filter
23:28:58 <TheWhisper> hm
23:29:09 <TheWhisper> Which orange specifically could use more contrast?
23:30:17 <Kocho> The underline oranges
23:30:42 <Kocho> Just very slightly. They look to me like they bleed into the background orange a little bit too much.
23:30:51 <TheWhisper> hm
23:30:59 <TheWhisper> Okay
23:31:05 <TheWhisper> I might try doing the double line trick thing
23:31:11 <TheWhisper> As right now I think they're just single lines
23:31:15 <TheWhisper> See how that works
23:31:17 <Kocho> Yes, that would be a good idea.
23:32:10 <TheWhisper> Anything else? :)
23:32:54 <medos> do
23:32:56 <medos> moar
23:32:58 <medos> try
23:33:00 <medos> moar
23:33:08 <Azra-el> pair
23:33:11 <Azra-el> flavors
23:33:13 <Azra-el> better
23:33:19 <Kocho> I agree with medos. You should just experiment and try different things.

23:34:55 <Azra-el> i havent submited it
23:35:28 <medos> lol
23:36:34 <Kocho> TheWhisper you have not discussed your two wheeled commuting method yet?
23:37:11 <medos> is he cybering you for advice?
23:37:20 <Kocho> Correct.
23:37:22 <medos> in private?
23:37:25 <medos> he's like moss
23:37:30 <Kocho> Incorrect.
23:37:34 <Kocho> But he is like moss.
23:37:58 <medos> "hey i gotta kno this shit now, gimme tutorial how this shizzle works"
23:38:06 <medos> forgets design for a week
23:38:15 <medos> repeat
23:38:16 <TheWhisper> I think you're forgetting the part
23:38:24 <TheWhisper> where I have been working on this
23:38:27 <TheWhisper> and not much else
23:38:32 <TheWhisper> for the past few weeks
23:38:43 <medos> yeah, because i stopped helping you
23:38:45 <medos> lol
23:38:54 <medos> would've been done quite some time ago
23:39:02 <Kocho> Luckily you don't work on an hourly rate or your client would be ballistic.
23:39:53 <Kocho> My clients aren't happy when I work on something for 5 minutes because I charge in quarter of an hour blocks.
23:41:17 <TheWhisper> Kocho, it's different than I'm in school
23:41:19 <TheWhisper> and this is free
23:41:20 <TheWhisper> :P
23:41:23 <TheWhisper> for a professor
23:41:23 <TheWhisper> lol
23:41:26 <Kocho> I know that.
23:41:36 <Kocho> I'm just saying what it is like beyond school.
23:41:50 <Kocho> If you decide to follow the prestigious path I am taking.
23:42:21 <medos> You will pay for every advice he gives.
23:42:26 <TheWhisper> Well obviously :P
23:42:35 <TheWhisper> Medos, what?
23:42:56 <medos> $$$ for shortcuts to get stuff done
23:43:08 <medos> :P
23:43:10 <Kocho> I would still like information regarding your bicycle.
23:43:13 <medos> Kocho http://dmonzon.com/
23:43:27 <Kocho> Is this like Amazon?
23:43:34 <medos> http://dmonzon.com/category/tools/
23:43:40 <medos> more specifically this shizzle
23:44:13 <Kocho> oh cool
23:44:23 <medos> first two posts are worth mentioning , rest is cs5
23:45:21 <Kocho> Trevor Morris Scripts one looks good.
23:45:50 <Kocho> The freebies are good too.
23:47:28 <medos> http://psdorganizer.dmonzon.com/
23:47:34 <medos> costs money and i don't need it
23:47:45 <medos> but in theory it's still awesome
23:49:03 <Kocho> Yeah, I agree.
23:49:16 <Kocho> I am still waiting for TheWhisper to tell me about his bicycle.
23:50:22 <medos> lol
23:50:44 <medos> i guess that's my advantage, i have two hours of free time right now
23:50:45 <medos> :P
23:51:03 <TheWhisper> Kocho, nothing really
23:51:08 <TheWhisper> I went in and talked to the owner
23:51:13 <TheWhisper> apparently it's a dude and his gf/wife
23:51:16 <TheWhisper> co-owning it
23:51:24 <TheWhisper> the dude was in and out so i only talked to him for a second and he was chill
23:51:30 <TheWhisper> his wife/gf was bitchy
23:51:50 <TheWhisper> and was like 'omg u dont kno evrything abot bikesS???? idioT!!!!'
23:52:02 <TheWhisper> but yeah, they said they had to fix up the tahoe a little bit
23:52:05 <Kocho> That's fair enough.
23:52:09 <TheWhisper> and then they'd call me and I could take it out for a test drive
23:52:28 <Kocho> hrmm… wonder what needs to be fixed?
23:52:44 <TheWhisper> I think I was just general tune up stuff
23:52:52 <TheWhisper> because they did offer to let me take it out today
23:52:58 <TheWhisper> but I said I'd wait until they fixed it up
23:53:07 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/nv8si.jpg
23:53:22 <Kocho> Should take them at least 45 minutes to 1 hour to tune up.
23:53:28 <TheWhisper> Idk
23:54:13 <Kocho> Oh well, see how you go.
23:54:25 <Kocho> Was it in good confidition?
23:55:26 <TheWhisper> Looked like 7.5/10
23:55:35 <TheWhisper> But hard to tell how much was just dirt and shit
23:55:39 <TheWhisper> and how much was actual problems
23:55:57 <TheWhisper> They had just loaned it out to someone last week
23:56:07 <TheWhisper> And the guy had just brought it back when I went in on Friday
23:57:02 <TheWhisper> http://i.imgur.com/V2dW9.jpg you guys sure you don't like that better
23:57:04 <TheWhisper> ;)
