17:52:36 <Whizper> hey anyone here
17:52:53 <Whizper> I need someone who uses CS6
17:52:56 <internetpolice> .seen anyone
17:52:57 <Whizper> specifically indesign
17:53:09 <EDSGD> I do.
17:53:22 <Whizper> Are CS6 indesign files compatible with CS5.5 indesign
17:53:30 <Whizper> like if I make it in cs6
17:53:31 <Whizper> can I then open it in cs5.5
17:53:42 <Whizper> Only asking because I know that 5.5 is not compatible with 5
17:54:01 <EDSGD> They are not.
17:54:13 <EDSGD> What you have to do is save the file as an idml
17:54:20 <EDSGD> If you're in CS6
17:54:24 <internetpolice> that extorts the crap
17:54:31 <internetpolice> out of indd
17:54:35 <internetpolice> literally
17:54:37 <internetpolice> :D
17:54:37 <Whizper> mother fucking shit cock fuck balls
17:54:45 <Whizper> What do you mean it extorts it?
17:54:51 <internetpolice> any plugin dependencies
17:54:56 <internetpolice> are gone in a idml
17:55:02 <internetpolice> markup language
17:55:07 <internetpolice> indesign markup language
17:55:07 <Whizper> Would that matter for just setting type?
17:55:10 <internetpolice> or some shit
17:55:16 <EDSGD> it'll get the file open.
17:55:19 <internetpolice> export as editable eps
17:55:27 <EDSGD> EPS
17:55:29 <EDSGD> ????
17:55:34 <EDSGD> tell me more.
17:55:38 <Whizper> i'll save in every way possible
17:55:41 <Whizper> Also
17:56:05 <Whizper> http://i.imgur.com/E5ik8.png all I've done so far
17:56:10 <EDSGD> I do know that idml in cs6 saving does a much better job at file handling

17:56:23 <Whizper> We have to make a beekeeping guide

19:01:30 <EDSGD> I don't want to loose my spot
19:01:32 <Whizper> I feel like my design
19:01:34 <Whizper> looks like
19:01:35 <Whizper> old
19:01:42 <EDSGD> remember 10012039120938 names
19:02:01 <medos> work with different colors
19:02:07 <medos> change colors when done
19:02:21 <EDSGD> will try it.
19:02:24 <EDSGD> brb
19:02:29 <Whizper> medos
19:02:32 <Whizper> can you take a look at this
19:02:34 <EDSGD> gonna go back to this fucking list
19:02:55 <medos> i might in a bit
19:03:47 <Whizper> medos, http://dl.dropbox.com/u/13494973/BeekeeperGuide_v1.pdf It's 3 pages and I don't want an in-depth right now (it's just a draft). Just like an overall feeling about it.
19:03:51 <Whizper> edsgd you can look too
19:04:05 <Whizper> So it won't take you long to glance at
19:04:28 <medos> zoom out to 10%
19:04:32 <Whizper> (grey bar on the side is something I just added and was playing with btw
19:04:35 <medos> does the ampersand still look aligned?
19:04:42 <medos> vadoo get your dang tool done
19:04:47 <medos> would make this easier ;)
19:04:54 <Whizper> hm
19:04:59 <Whizper> I aligned the top of the ampersand
19:05:02 <Whizper> not the bottom
19:05:07 <Whizper> *not the bottom left
19:05:09 <medos> horizontal
19:05:13 <medos> not vertical
19:05:18 <Whizper> so this way the words are aligned on the left
19:05:22 <Whizper> *right side
19:05:27 <Whizper> The S's are both aligned 
19:05:36 <Whizper> You think that's bad though?
19:05:46 <medos> hello
19:05:48 <medos> bello
19:06:00 <medos> does that look cool to you?
19:06:08 <Whizper> uh
19:06:12 <Whizper> It looks like nothing
19:06:16 <Whizper> because
19:06:23 <Whizper> the webchat is mnospaced
19:06:25 <Whizper> *monospaced
19:06:59 <medos> it looks off balance
19:07:00 <medos> at a glance
19:07:09 <Whizper> hm
19:08:03 <Whizper> http://i.imgur.com/LsG6D.png 
19:08:05 <Whizper> idk
19:08:43 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/8hG6U.png
19:08:49 <Whizper> nvm it does look better
19:08:53 <Whizper> just took me a minute to get used to it
19:09:01 <vadoo> doing my best (kinda)
19:09:16 <vadoo> you guys carry on, this is really interesting :)
19:09:20 <Whizper> That's an interesting ampersand, medos
19:09:26 <medos> &
19:09:43 <Whizper> Anyway I see it now
19:09:47 <Whizper> Left aligned looks better
19:10:53 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/MN0KV.png
19:10:59 <medos> too close
19:11:08 <medos> makes everything to the right of it look like wasted space
19:11:12 <Whizper> yeah
19:11:22 <Whizper> I was just trying to think of a way to fix that
19:11:38 <medos> go forth and fix that then
19:11:39 <medos> =)
19:12:41 <medos> Whizper
19:12:57 <Whizper> what
19:12:59 <Whizper> I could switdch the words
19:13:05 <Whizper> To be "Hexagons & Honeycombes"
19:13:11 <Whizper> so then the ampersand could be on the top
19:13:20 <Whizper> also, what?
19:14:08 <medos> activate contextual alternatives?
19:14:20 <Whizper> oh
19:14:36 <medos> or do less italic
19:14:45 <Whizper> um
19:14:45 <medos> because the title for chapter one
19:14:47 <Whizper> it is activated
19:14:59 <medos> looks like it should be connected
19:15:09 <medos> it's too cursive/curly to just go letter by letter
19:15:22 <medos> o v e rv i e w
19:15:29 <Whizper> haven't kerned anything
19:15:45 <medos> not sure if kerning would fix that
19:16:01 <Whizper> It only has fi fl kerns
19:16:09 <medos> just not bold/strong enough to be a chapter title
19:16:24 <medos> imo
19:16:24 <Whizper> I didn't make up the text
19:16:26 <medos> :P
19:16:28 <Whizper> You mean weightwise?
19:16:34 <Whizper> Or the actual title?
19:16:54 <medos> first chapter
19:17:01 <medos> the word overview
19:17:19 <medos> doesn't look like a chapter title
19:17:34 <Whizper> oh ok
19:17:56 <Whizper> Do you think it looks like
19:17:57 <Whizper> old
19:17:59 <Whizper> and like
19:18:03 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/Nlrys.png
19:18:04 <Whizper> stereotypical manual
19:18:05 <medos> SERIF
19:18:09 <medos> CURSIVE
19:18:10 <medos> vs
19:18:12 <medos> sans
19:18:22 <medos> two attributes to stand out
19:18:29 <medos> vs sans serif which looks bland anyway
19:18:40 <medos> it's too harsh of a contrast
19:18:42 <medos> imo
19:18:44 <Whizper> ah
19:18:45 <medos> D:
19:18:54 <Whizper> I know what you mean
19:19:00 <Whizper> I wish it had like a light italic
19:20:32 <medos> stroke align inside white
19:20:34 <medos> gogogo
19:20:35 <medos> hahaha
19:20:48 <medos> or outline and shear it
19:20:51 <medos> derp
19:20:57 <medos> worst advice ever
19:21:01 <medos> don't do those two please
19:21:48 <Whizper> lol
19:21:51 <Whizper> I won't
19:21:52 <Whizper> don't worry
19:22:18 <medos> why new baskerville not baskerville?
19:23:10 <Whizper> uh
19:23:39 <Whizper> I have
19:23:42 <Whizper> ITC New Baskerville
19:23:48 <Whizper> And Baskerville Cyrillic
19:24:05 <medos> sounds like it's time to learn russian then
19:24:08 <Whizper> Oh looks like there's also a Baskerville system font? Is that any good?
19:25:11 <medos> baskerville the typeface of truth - random movie director who compared it to comic sans
19:25:33 <Whizper> I remember
19:25:57 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/CksF2.png
19:26:20 <Whizper> http://i.imgur.com/4Kodu.png not really a fan of the weird strokes
19:26:37 <Whizper> And by that I mean the heaviness of the capital
19:26:39 <Whizper> vs the rest
19:27:17 <medos> your problem is baskerville being too thin vs univers
19:27:26 <Whizper> hm

19:32:10 <medos> center
19:32:16 <medos> alignment?
19:32:18 <medos> for the title
19:32:24 <medos> chapter title that is
19:32:55 <medos> i could be talking bullshit but most of my memories with books and serif chapter titles are
19:32:57 <medos> centered

20:52:42 <Kocho> morning
20:53:28 <thearrowflies> Azra-el: are you rmmh?
20:53:47 <Azra-el> .g rmmh
20:53:59 <thearrowflies> ahh
20:54:02 <Azra-el> SPAM :)
20:54:13 <thearrowflies> this is for a game o.0
20:54:25 <Azra-el> who is rmmh
20:54:33 <thearrowflies> the guy who make yourbot
20:54:36 <thearrowflies> made
20:54:58 <Azra-el> oh no.... just put it on one of my servers
20:55:08 <thearrowflies> o.o
20:55:22 <thearrowflies> i wish i had many servers like you
20:55:27 <thearrowflies> so i could run my bot 24/7
20:55:36 <EDSGD> :p
20:56:10 <Azra-el> 1. dont have that many servers (yet) ... 2. as i was saying... if arrowbot is better... i can host it instead of awesomius (altho i like Awesomius nick better :P)
20:56:24 <thearrowflies> can you host both?
20:56:38 <thearrowflies> you have some features that i dont
20:56:51 <Azra-el> well.. there should only be one bot
20:56:53 <thearrowflies> if you cant host both, i could port over stuff
20:57:44 <Azra-el> hosting both is not a problem. having two bots in the channel that answer to .g .. well... not good :)
20:58:15 <medos> imagine people who are at work
20:58:17 <thearrowflies> i can disable g
20:58:21 <medos> and want to read up on the conversation
20:58:32 <medos> and see tons of endlessly long bot replies
20:58:34 <thearrowflies> they can simply ignore any long bot message
20:58:42 <medos> that's kinda what happened with arrowbot a bit ;)
20:58:52 <thearrowflies> .list alias
20:59:09 <medos> for example
20:59:11 <medos> .help
20:59:15 <Azra-el> i would still only have one bot and one bot only and that one bot should have all the features ... that all
20:59:21 <medos> having it in pm is faaaaaaar more comfortable
20:59:29 <Azra-el> and a GOOD suggestion is only respond to some in public
20:59:32 <Azra-el> yes.. like medos said
20:59:43 <thearrowflies> i can make that happen
20:59:45 <thearrowflies> thing is
20:59:53 <thearrowflies> i run it in other channels
20:59:56 <thearrowflies> and people like it like this
21:00:28 <Azra-el> make the bot have some commands in private and some in public... and ill host the version for this channel on my server.. everybody's happy
21:01:02 <thearrowflies> ok
21:01:17 <thearrowflies> upgrade to python 2.7.3
21:01:19 <thearrowflies> then
21:01:22 <medos> lol
21:01:27 <thearrowflies> install supybot
21:02:02 <Azra-el> i mean.. have the other version for other channels if other channels like spam :) and we get clean stuff :P
21:02:25 <thearrowflies> well its not spam, medos just has a really small irc window >.>
21:02:41 <medos> Imagine an average guy who never used irc
21:02:45 <medos> which is very likely
21:02:50 <Azra-el> i for one im with medos on this... i hate spammy bots
21:02:57 <medos> with r/graphic_design guys
21:03:12 <medos> and they see TheWhisper pasting 8 lines of text with ... and a few links
21:03:16 <medos> and arrowbot going bonkers
21:03:23 <medos> it's alienating
21:03:28 <medos> ...
21:03:33 <medos> :P
21:03:37 <thearrowflies> some of the other channels im on
21:03:43 <thearrowflies> people dont even have a cleint
21:03:48 <thearrowflies> and
21:03:49 <thearrowflies> they love it
21:03:58 <thearrowflies> even with the 'spammy' parts
21:04:13 <thearrowflies> and these people arent exactly tech savvy
21:04:16 <Azra-el> glad im not on those channels ;)
21:04:20 <thearrowflies> but i get what your saying
21:04:24 <thearrowflies> i have to be
21:04:46 <medos> i don't mind arrowbot but .help
21:04:55 <thearrowflies> .help
21:04:56 <medos> and a lot of details just could be compressed
21:05:03 <thearrowflies> but
21:05:10 <medos> why does everyone need to read that ? :P
21:05:11 <thearrowflies> if i compress stuff
21:05:18 <thearrowflies> people wont understand
21:05:23 <Azra-el> dont compress anything
21:05:23 <thearrowflies> no one needs to
21:05:25 <Azra-el> make it PM
21:05:27 <Azra-el> that all
21:05:51 <thearrowflies> what if you want the channel to see something
21:05:59 <medos> like? :P
21:06:03 <thearrowflies> idunno
21:06:13 <thearrowflies> maybe i want you to all see a google result
21:06:22 <thearrowflies> but that plugin is pm only
21:06:22 <Azra-el> thats what i meant
21:06:38 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/mxcbp.png

21:11:24 <Azra-el> MOREEEEEEEEEEEEEE
21:11:26 <thearrowflies> you kept saying more
21:11:28 <Kocho> lmao
21:11:30 <medos> yeah
21:11:32 <medos> fml
21:11:40 <medos> thearrowflies if he replies in the channel
21:11:43 <medos> max 1 line
21:11:44 <medos> no more
21:11:49 <medos> that's kinda what i want
21:11:50 <thearrowflies> but
21:11:52 <thearrowflies> you just said
21:11:57 <thearrowflies> you want a description
21:11:58 <thearrowflies> not a link
21:12:05 <Azra-el> .u cleveland steamer
21:12:17 <Azra-el> =))
21:12:27 <medos> ;(
21:12:30 <thearrowflies> and people dont have to do .more
21:12:40 <thearrowflies> so its not liek its going to be spamming everything
21:12:50 <Azra-el> oh and ALWAYS reply Azra-el: Error: "u" is not a valid command. in PM
21:12:58 <medos> http://i.imgur.com/gw2HG.png
21:13:05 <thearrowflies> thats only one line
21:13:07 <medos> 1 line max
21:13:13 <medos> no more
21:13:15 <medos> ;(
21:13:25 <medos> being precise is good not being precise is not being helpful
21:13:27 <thearrowflies> awesomeius was one line
21:13:34 <thearrowflies> more than*
21:13:43 <medos> look
21:13:46 <medos> my major problem was
21:13:48 <medos> (no offense)
21:13:55 <medos> that i have a fucking hard time catching up
21:13:57 <medos> on what happened
21:14:04 <medos> when TheWhisper sets up three bombs
21:14:15 <medos> and i'm chief here so i have to care about guests kinda
21:14:18 <thearrowflies> thats not the bots fault >.>
21:14:32 <medos> and if the bot is making my life harder
21:14:45 <medos> i try to fix that by telling you to make it as unintrusive as possible
21:14:50 <medos> then you say other channels like that
21:15:25 <medos> which does not help me at all
21:16:07 <Azra-el> again... im with medos on this... ill host whatever you guys decide... no problem.. yadda yadda... now smoking and getting off my ass with getting some work done
21:16:08 <thearrowflies> i can agree that some commands have alot of text and you might be annoyed by that, but the bot isnt talking by itself, if someone is setting up bombs all the time, and you dont like that i can make the bot ignore them
21:16:26 <thearrowflies> your irc client
21:16:30 <thearrowflies> with *
21:16:41 <thearrowflies> you can see the difference between each users text
21:16:53 <thearrowflies> because anything more than one line
21:16:55 <thearrowflies> is indented
21:17:16 <thearrowflies> so, no offense, i dont see why its that hard
21:17:26 <medos> .ud
21:17:30 <medos> does it
21:17:42 <thearrowflies> does it?
21:17:43 <medos> :(
21:20:08 <medos> ?dwi
21:20:28 <medos> I have no idea how to solve this if you're that defensive of your bot, i don't mind if arrowbot is here.
21:20:30 <thearrowflies> deal with what?
21:20:32 <thearrowflies> im convused
21:20:33 <medos> :P
21:20:35 <medos> i'm too
21:20:45 <thearrowflies> i can see where you are coming from
21:20:52 <thearrowflies> i just dont see how its thaat big of a problem
21:21:04 <thearrowflies> and i dont object to Azra-el hosting another one just for this chan
21:21:30 <medos> yupyup
21:21:34 <medos> i like the reddit stuff
21:21:47 <medos> i like it being entertaining for edsgd when he's bored
21:21:58 <medos> but i don't like constant bombardment with one and the same help message
21:22:02 <medos> or bomb game
21:22:09 <medos> or list of commands
21:22:14 <medos> that's redundant
21:22:19 <EDSGD> what about me
21:22:22 <thearrowflies> .config list supybot.plugins.timebomb
21:22:24 <EDSGD> ????
21:22:40 <thearrowflies> .config list supybot.plugins.timebomb.showArt false

21:23:21 <marshmallow> roar, i'm out.  buh bye
21:23:27 <thearrowflies> cya
21:24:09 <medos> that does not work in private? D:
21:24:20 <thearrowflies> it does :p
21:24:26 <medos> why do it in here then?

21:29:12 <thearrowflies> Azra-el: have you done what i said?
21:31:41 <Azra-el> nope... too time consuming to update python right now... ill ask my partner to do it for me tomorrow...  after all i guess i dont need the stock supybot right?
21:31:57 <medos> thearrowflies that's exactly my point
21:32:08 <thearrowflies> stock is good
21:32:11 <medos> why should i have the workload of TheWhisper acting like a dick
21:32:22 <thearrowflies> i can make the bot ignore him
21:32:24 <medos> and teaching him not to bomb for some reason
21:32:28 <thearrowflies> if thats what you want
21:32:49 <medos> then he feels left out and i'm the ass
21:32:54 <medos> for disabling his power to use commands?
21:33:08 <thearrowflies> i can disable it per command

21:34:15 <thearrowflies> its good

21:43:50 <thearrowflies> "google" without the dot is only one result, ".google" and ".g" are many results

21:45:12 <medos> can do tomorrow
21:45:35 <thearrowflies> :(

21:48:00 <Azra-el> thearrowflies... mate.. we only want what's best for this channel. a bot is not needed.. but its a nice toy to have arround. a bot should not be spammy. a bot should be like a ninja buttler. fetch you what you need and then gtfo. its not such a big channel that it needs user management so ... best use of a bot as i see it is google/youtube/wiki search and paste in channel. the rules for 
21:48:00 <Azra-el> said paste should be 1. one reply - one result 2. if command is invalid/nonexistant  the error message should be posted in pm 3. list/help we should be posted in pm
21:48:06 <medos> :P
21:48:13 <thearrowflies> that was an example, no one really googles reddit
21:48:41 <Azra-el> reply to search should be top result only. less spammy
21:48:47 <thearrowflies> yes
21:48:50 <thearrowflies> for example
21:48:53 <thearrowflies> google reddit
21:48:56 <thearrowflies> 1 link
21:49:06 <thearrowflies> first result
21:49:08 <medos> write up a faq
21:49:11 <medos> on commands for it
21:49:14 <medos> or something
21:49:18 <medos> :P
21:49:22 <thearrowflies> thats what .help is for
21:49:30 <thearrowflies> or
21:49:34 <thearrowflies> google supybot commands
21:49:47 <Azra-el> i said my part. those 3 points are paramount for me in a bot
21:49:49 <medos> teach that to every new user here
21:49:52 <medos> pweassssee
21:49:54 <medos> then we're in
21:50:15 <thearrowflies> the more people that know, the more people that will use it
21:50:25 <thearrowflies> and a million one line things would be spammy also
21:50:37 <Azra-el> medos... it's easy to great every joining user with /notify Hi I'm bot... glad to help you for a list of commands please write .help in pm
21:50:53 <medos> meh
21:51:14 <medos> i'll just put "type .help to show commands in the topic or welcome message"
21:51:16 <thearrowflies> yes
21:51:18 <medos> .help
21:51:20 <EDSGD> :D
21:51:21 <thearrowflies> i can greet users with that
21:51:41 <medos> .help plugin
21:51:49 <thearrowflies> plugin is not a plugin
21:51:51 <medos> help what command
21:51:53 <Azra-el> sure but dont reply to .help in public chat ... that's the whole point
21:51:57 <thearrowflies> .help google
21:52:28 <medos> that's bot documentation
21:52:30 <medos> not help
21:52:38 <medos> string
21:52:41 <medos> [{}]
21:52:53 <medos> shit like that does not belong in the channel or a help message in the first place
21:53:04 <medos> explain that to a novice mac graphic designer who never coded in his life
21:53:12 <medos> it's redundant and intrusive to every other person
21:53:16 <medos> in the channel
21:53:18 <thearrowflies> where are you seeing string [{}]
21:53:24 <medos> [--{filter,language} <value>]) --
21:53:29 <thearrowflies> oh
21:53:33 <medos> gle.com for the given string.
21:53:44 <thearrowflies> that doesnt have to do with programming, everyone uses that for irc
21:53:44 <medos> that's the worst "help" i've ever gotten
21:53:52 <medos> everyone?
21:53:56 <thearrowflies> [] is optional
21:54:01 <thearrowflies> <> required
21:54:09 <thearrowflies> {} also optional
21:54:10 <medos> who knows that?
21:54:12 <Azra-el> lol :) i had no idea and i kinda program stuff ;))
21:54:15 <thearrowflies> people who use irc..
21:54:26 <medos> EDSGD !
21:54:38 <Azra-el> and i've been on irc since 95
21:54:55 <thearrowflies> i see it all the time
21:54:59 <thearrowflies> even for non irc things
21:55:00 <medos> i'm trying to make this as little alienating as possible for people who never used irc
21:55:38 <medos> you can't presume that every guy has the same technical knowledge
21:55:46 <medos> a chat is a chat
21:55:57 <thearrowflies> that is true
21:56:03 <medos> facebook chatwindows don't suddenly pop up with [google]}filter SEND STRING
21:56:12 <thearrowflies> neither does a bot
21:56:13 <medos> wtf is that says average graphic designer macbookproguy
21:56:21 <thearrowflies> you have to tell the bot "hey i want help"
21:56:25 <thearrowflies> for it to reply with something
21:56:41 <medos> in the channel with other people watching you fail at writing commands?
21:56:44 <medos> it's like
21:56:57 <medos> irc is not for everyone
21:57:00 <thearrowflies> i dont like spam
21:57:01 <thearrowflies> but
21:57:13 <medos> i'm trying to make it a little less weird
21:57:17 <medos> so please
21:57:22 <thearrowflies> with yours, and my irc setup it seems easy
21:57:23 <medos> don't argue with "usual irc"
21:57:24 <medos> :P
21:57:26 <thearrowflies> to ignore tyhe bot
21:57:32 <thearrowflies> >.>
21:57:44 <thearrowflies> i cant change it
21:57:51 <thearrowflies> because other chans
21:57:52 <thearrowflies> but
21:58:04 <thearrowflies> if azra wants to, he can host another version
21:59:14 <medos> it's more about me trying to minimize the bot to be useful
21:59:25 <medos> not about who hosts it
21:59:27 <medos> or where it sits
21:59:32 <thearrowflies> i know
21:59:34 <medos> when it's intrusive during an actual discussion
21:59:39 <medos> that's no good for anyone
21:59:52 <thearrowflies> but i cant change ccertain features because other people like it how it is
22:00:05 <thearrowflies> so that why i say if he wants to host it he can
22:00:48 <medos> :P
22:00:54 <medos> i'll think about this a bit more tomorrow
22:01:24 <medos> i'm just exhaaaaausted from explaining why it's intrusive
22:01:26 <medos> :D
22:01:54 <thearrowflies> look at this then: http://i.imgur.com/O8ORg.jpg
22:02:03 <medos> lol
22:02:08 <medos> no
22:02:11 <medos> need to do some work
22:02:17 <medos> besides finding an even balance
22:02:24 <medos> between funbot and useful bot
22:02:27 <thearrowflies> hire a slave
22:02:36 <medos> fiverr it is
22:02:45 <thearrowflies> fiverr?
22:03:23 <medos> can't type urls googl it

22:03:48 <thearrowflies> why cant you type urls?
22:04:26 <medos> triggering bots
22:04:29 <medos> lol
22:04:38 <medos> i am adapting
22:04:47 <medos> one wrong move and a command might be set off
22:05:32 <thearrowflies> urls only get page titles
22:05:34 <thearrowflies> or reddit posts
22:05:39 <thearrowflies> you said you like that
22:06:05 <thearrowflies> hmm
22:06:06 <thearrowflies> brb
22:06:50 <medos> lol
22:07:49 <medos> nerdiest thing i've ever done in my life is have an in depth discussion about python bot usability and helpfulness for irc beginners
22:08:39 <EDSGD> 2 more pages :D
22:09:14 <medos> being prominently displayed in the sidebar of a +10k people subreddit which is run by several professional graphic designers
22:09:22 <medos> as a chat about design
22:09:37 <medos> and people looking for a designer maybe even in here
22:09:46 <medos> while bombs and commands and help text appears
22:10:02 <medos> might be alienating
22:10:07 <medos> if that makes any sense whatsoever
22:10:13 <medos> EDSGD invert the colors
22:10:20 <EDSGD> I have.
22:10:26 <EDSGD> Easier on the eyes.
